Sure, you’ve got nothing better to do except infuse all your garments with some horrendous stench. It’s a perk of the job. The cartographer must’ve had a perky job too, given this desolate slice of coast. Instead of majestic cliffs or a nice sandy beach, you’re greeted with precipitous hills and a ragged assortment of rocks. You find the cave, half by the cartographer’s substandard directions and half by scent. The entrance looks like a gap among broken teeth. Water flows in and out— more in than out, it appears. The tide is rising. You’re loath to give up, but you’ll have to hurry to make this trip worthwhile. Steering your dinghy in, you enter the cave and almost immediately sense something bumping the bow. A blood-orange fin splices the water. You shudder and shine your light further in. There’s more. A school of piranha pigs, swimming around contorted shapes. The place is littered with rusty machine parts. Those might be worth something, right? You hope you can salvage them before the tide recruits you to its watery graveyard. Unfortunately, you have to contend with more than just the ocean. At the back of the cave, the mother of all piranha pigs, larger than your boat, waits smugly. She unhinges her jaw, displaying stacks of teeth below her deceivingly cute snout. You wonder if she was once some Abael’s beloved familiar. Or if she escaped slaughter for meat, and built her brood here. Either way, she’s not overly fond of you two-legged folk. She lashes her tail and the water churns as her offspring dive toward you. The Piranha Pig adjacent to the barrel is the Giant Piranha Pig. It has HxC hit points, 1, and a base move value of 1. All hexes to the left of any water tiles are also treated as water (difficult terrain). When any character starts their turn in water, they suffer hazardous terrain damage. Set up the Boss monster ability deck and initiative token. During ordering of initiative each round until the Giant Piranha Pig is dead, reveal one Boss card, then apply any Special effects listed below on the card’s initiative. If any Ancient Artillery is ever in water, it dies. If any overlay tile other than corridors is ever in water, it is destroyed. If the barrel is destroyed, the scenario is lost. x7 x3 x3 x3 x2 x1 x1 Move all water tiles two hexes to the right. Move all water tiles one hex to the right.

The sky becomes somber, the air colder, and you wrap your cloak tighter around you, moving forward, despite the growing unease inside of you. Just before you left, you gathered more information about this Lady in White. Some say she is the lost soul of a woodsman’s bride, murdered by wayward bandits on their wedding night. Some say she is a priestess, preying on the innocent unborn souls to keep herself immortal. They say that the only way to stop her is to destroy the pieces of her soul hidden in the towering balete trees in the woods. You walk forward into the grove, but your progress is slowed by the trees’ roots, tangled over giant boulders. Then you see a flash of white from the corner of your eye. You turn and catch a glimpse of her horrifying visage before she melts into the trunk of a tree. You approach it and see her outline in the gnarls and knots of the bark. But, as quickly as she dissolved, she emerges and retreats to another tree deeper in. You move to follow, but notice something is amiss; there are other creatures here, hiding in the trees, waiting for their moment to strike. You pull your attention away from the ghost and take stock of your surroundings. You are about to be attacked, yes, but you also notice that the trees this apparition inhabits have glowing green roots, and you know instinctively that this is how you will survive.

Thank goodness you are coming to our aid!” The Algox cries as she passes the load over to you. “This Vanjal is a monster.

Once this happens, the Frozen Corpse heals all damage and then acts as if spawned. When a Frozen Corpse dies, instead of a loot token, it drops one numbered token.

Try as the crew might, it is impossible to keep the ship from being blown down the coast, away from Frosthaven’s safe harbor. More troubling still, this stretch of coastline features no bay in which to shelter—just looming cliffs. And then the worst happens: the mainsail gives way, ripping apart into tattered fragments. “Abandon ship!” The captain cries, and the crew scramble to lower the jolly boats. You do likewise, and manage to get one of the small craft lowered to the water just in time. You pile into it and row furiously, heading for shore as the Lucky Lady smashes itself to pieces on the coast’s jagged rocks. Below your jolly boat, crackles of light come from the depths: the flashes of deadly lightning eels. Above the howling wind, you hear the screams of someone who was tossed into the sea; part of you hopes it was Rattusca, the Vermling whose chance meeting caused you to undertake this misadventure. After much rowing and more than one near capsize, you manage to land the jolly boat on a narrow strip of beach—a thin ribbon of land between looming cliffs and the angry gray sea. You scramble onto shore, only to find your troubles are not yet done. On either side of you, Lurkers advance menacingly toward you.

Whenever there are no characters on the rightmost map tile (or the hex halfway on it), any character may move through the leftmost wall line to scroll the map forward. When this occurs, immediately remove everything on the rightmost map tile from the map and connect that tile to the leftmost one, placing five corridor hexes where the map tiles now transition so there are no walls between the map tiles. Then reveal one of the remaining numbered tokens and set up the new left tile as depicted in the corresponding map section, proceeding as if it were a newly revealed room.

The floor trembles, and a thin blue path of light appears, extending farther into the facility. With a gentle creak, a smooth metal platform beside you begins to impossibly rise, hovering a few inches off the rail line below. It seems sturdy enough to bear a load. Without further explanation, it trundles forward on the blue path toward a doorway blocked by a cave-in ahead. While the system has seemed welcoming so far, not every component is eager to see you—an automated turret rises out of the ground and aims right at you. Each debris, regardless of size, has L+10 hit points. They are enemies to you and allies to all monsters. At the end of each round, floating platform B moves one hex toward door 1, its back hex always entering the hex its front hex exits. Tiles, tokens, or figures on the floating platform move with it. Each character occupying it may increase this movement by one hex. The floating platform destroys all traps and terrain it enters, and it can open doors. If the front hex of the floating platform enters a hex occupied by any figure, the figure suffers L+6 and is placed in the closest empty hex. If the floating platform would enter any debris, the debris instead suffers L+6 and the platform ends its movement. Door 1 is locked and will unlock when the floating platform moves adjacent to it. If any character becomes exhausted, the scenario is lost. x14 x1 x3 x1 x1 Design and writing: Alexander JL Theoharis 96 • E11 Underground Station 2023 CEPHALOFAIR GAMES, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

It’s been six days of marching through the snow with Gem as your guide. The too-old Orchid hasn’t suggested the bitter cold has any effect on her, but the sheer weight of crystals grown on her body over a lifetime has meant the trip, which should have been two days at most, has taken the better part of a week. She finally takes a seat on a rocky outcropping and points a heavy finger at the stone doorway in front of you. “Well, this is the part I’m paying for. Prison is just this way, I trust you’ll have no trouble whatsoever. It would be a true surprise if any of the guards lasted this long!” She settles in, humming to herself. The stone door’s lock has long ago rusted away, and the chamber beyond is dark and silent—no one has disturbed this for what feels like centuries. You wonder what kind of prison this even is. You find a sconce and light it. By some unseen mechanism, the fire jumps across the room, lighting the area in a warm glow. The prison has a high ceiling with a third- story catwalk, and illuminated before you is a massive cell door, shut tight. Before you can deal with the door, though, you’ll need to deal with the guards, which are not as long-dead as you had hoped. So much for this being an easy job. Door 1 is locked. All figures on any tile 1 treat all figures on tile 13-C as in range and line-of-sight for any ranged attack.

You find Bartlet, the last surviving member of Gem’s mercenary group, slumped in the corner of an unassuming cave, right where Zu said. The mood is more somber and less celebratory than you expected. Gem strokes her hand over Bartlet’s unconscious forehead. “A Savvas is granted all the life it will ever have the day it’s born under the Copperneck Mountains. From then forward, their lives have a finite energy, and when they take their last step, they return to being just the rocks they once were.” She taps her finger against Bartlet’s forehead, but there’s no response. “Oh sure, they can top off some dribs and drabs by eating some rocks, but the reality is that every step they take, every spell they cast, every word they speak—it marches them closer to the end of their lives. Macabre, really. Could you imagine? Knowing you have just a hundred fifty years, give or take, and everything you do counts against it? That’s why a Savvas’s life is so focused, they know they have to make the most of the little time they have.” Gem stops for a moment, and when she continues speaking, there’s a line of wetness under her eyes. “By that same token, if a Savvas were to just stop moving, to think no more thoughts, and just settle where it sat… well, it could live for a very long time.

But there was a fourth... what you today call a Lurker. Ripple was the best of us. We took a job, and we chose... the wrong path. We were manipulated, and it wound up with Ripple dead and the rest of us outlaws. We couldn’t show our faces anywhere. Zu was imprisoned, and I hid. Bartlet... poor, sweet Bartlet just gave up.

She places it gently, delicately against the temple of the resting Savaas, and then with surprising strength pushes her long, sharp digit into the creature’s skull until her finger is embedded down to the knuckle. “What now? Now they go in and put its mind to rest. Find the Savvas in there and help it move on.” She looks back at you, all business, and encourages you to hold one of the sharp crystal protrusions on her back. “What are you waiting for?

It takes many hours of hard-fought traipsing, requiring an even mix of hurdling, crawling, and the occasional axework, but the energy is not hard to find because you know you’re onto something. In the fading light, you find yourselves at a plateau. The brick path opens into a wide, crescent-shaped courtyard on surprisingly level ground.

You reach out and feel a smooth, transparent wall of ice. You look to the mirror for guidance, but all it reflects back to you is your face—dead, rotten, and worm-ridden.

If any falling figure is unable to occupy a safe hex due to figures blocking both of its paths, they stop falling, and all figures occupying the two hexes directly below them suffer L, as well.

You are in a forest of ice, giant crystalline trees sprouting up all around you, sending their roots of frost through the snowy earth. Wandering the landscape, you eventually come to one of the largest trees you have ever seen, its gnarled trunk stretching high into the heavens. At its base is an opening just large enough for you to enter, and so, with some trepidation, you step through. In an instant, your mind feels like it has been pulled inside out. You intuitively know that somehow existence itself is being stretched out, as if time and space were a rubber band.

All ice spikes, snowdrifts, and snow rocks of any size in the scenario are unaffected by abilities and collectively represent ice clusters, which start as one hex of ice spikes. At the end of each round, each ice cluster will grow one hex in the direction of its arrow depicted on the scenario map. Whenever any ice cluster first grows, move its ice spikes as directed and create one snowdrift in the hex the ice spikes exited. Whenever it grows subsequently, move both its ice spike and snowdrift as directed and place one snow rock in the hex the snowdrift exited, combining two snow rocks into one large snow rock when possible. Whenever any tile would move through a wall line, remove it from the map. If an ice spike tile enters a hex occupied by a non-flying figure, the figure suffers hazardous terrain damage. Likewise, if an obstacle is placed in a hex occupied by a non-flying figure, the figure suffers hazardous terrain damage and is forced to move to the closest empty hex. Whenever two ice clusters grow into each other, both their tiles share the same hex. In this way, a hex can be both hazardous and difficult terrain at the same time, but when it becomes an obstacle, the obstacle overrides all other features. If any ice spikes enter any non-cluster overlay tile, they instead destroy the tile. Throughout the scenario, if you run out of tiles as the ice clusters grow, use suitable replacements or remove those that no longer affect the scenario. x10 x4 x2 x2 x1 x1 the forest has changed considerably. You have been thrust back hundreds, maybe thousands, of years in time. As you travel downward, deep into the frozen root system of the gargantuan tree, you see numerous skeletons on the ground, some of which have turned into naught but dust. Additionally, the roots themselves writhe and undulate, becoming longer and thicker before your eyes. Time is being sped up. The rubber band is contracting, and time is moving accordingly. Fortunately, the magic of the amulet protects you from the accelerated time, unlike the skeletons strewn about the entrance. As even more of the crystalline roots above you start to tendril their way downward, you realize that soon, they will take up every available space. You’d better make haste while there’s still a path to your goal, or this tree will become your tomb.

Folklore. It was the cheapest plot of land available, and close to the main road leading to Frosthaven— full of traveling folk in need of a frosty snack.” Sadly, Joseph discovered that the folklore is less folklore and more fact. The field turned out to be rife with spirits and wraiths. Not to mention the recent infestation of snow imps. “It’s safe to say that the stand is a no go, but I still need to retrieve all the ice- cream. I poured my life savings into that merchandise!” Joseph’s arms gesticulate wildly in the air, as if independent from his body. “I managed to recruit some local townsfolk—call them Joseph’s helpers— to carry it back. Problem is, they’re too scared to cross the field to reach the stand. This is where you come in. Cross the field, deal with the incorporeals and get the merchandise to my helpers.

You hesitate, but they are already heading for you instead and look to be accompanied by an individual with fiery red hair. The two brothers call for a round and greet you like kin. You are almost inebriated just from the smell coming off them, and they’re laughing so hard, you can’t tell if they’re dying. They introduce you to Derrick Windmere, who doesn’t particularly look like he fits in with the pair, but also looks like he’s had a few himself. The brothers begin to tell Derrick how you saved them from certain death one time, and, even if you wanted to disagree, between the two of them, you couldn’t get a word in edgewise. It starts with how you were all traveling together, back when they did a little mercenary work, of course, and you were accosted by Abaeli, Lurkers, Algox, and Unfettered. Derrick questions the assortment with a chuckle, but Narb just says, “Exactly.” Mugs of ale are brought to the table, and Narb tells how he and his brother were worn out from a previous engagement and you managed to convince them, albeit after a fair amount of effort, to hang back and allow you to prove you were worthy of accompanying them.

If any non-flying character enters a water hex without an ice tile, they suffer hazardous terrain damage. All ice tiles D are treated as corridors but are not considered featureless. They are placed on water tiles but do not replace them. At the start of each round, place one new ice tile in each B (if able) and treat them as ice tiles D. Then each ice tile D, in left-to-right order, moves one, two, or three hexes directly left, as chosen by you. All ice tiles in the same row must move the same number of hexes, and each row must move a different amount. Whenever any ice tile moves, it moves any non-flying characters, non-flying character summons, and tokens in its hex along with it.

If any ice tile would end its movement in an occupied hex, it instead continues moving in the same direction until it enters an unoccupied hex.

Place one numbered token in each corresponding hex 1 through $ in ascending order for each gem noted at the end of How to Lay an Ambush (129). These tokens may be looted as normal by characters and then placed on their character mat. Each character can carry any number of tokens, but each character adds -1 to each of their move abilities for each token they are carrying after the first. All characters may also drop any number of tokens they are carrying into the hex they occupy at any time during their turn (including during movement). Whenever any character suffers damage while carrying tokens, they must immediately place one of those tokens in an adjacent hex, prioritizing water or ice tiles closest to C. At the start of each round, any tokens on water hexes move directly left the same number of hexes as the ice tiles in their row and are also removed from the map upon exiting C. Each A is an escape hex. If any character becomes exhausted or there are not enough numbered tokens to complete the scenario, the scenario is lost. Design and writing: Mathew G.

That’s the question Captain Doghogger keeps voicing after you and Dinah enlist him to sail you out to the X marked on the map. He tries on different inflections, as if he will be recounting this story in the Boiled Crab later. Dinah looks ready to make him walk the plank. Luckily, her murderous tendencies are curbed when she spots her quarry, a seemingly unremarkable cliff face. Each character adds two cards to their attack modifier deck. When door 1 is opened, read 191.2. The scenario is complete when all enemies in it are dead. At the end of that round, read 138.3. Given the treacherous rocks, Captain Doghogger can’t sail any closer. Dinah commands him to anchor while you take a dinghy. At her imperiousness, the Captain gives her a side-eye, but she side-eyes him right back, and eventually, the battle tips in her favor. He anchors. With Dinah at the prow in the dinghy, you row to the cliff face. “Keep rowing,” she says, eyes glittering, and nervously, you do so, until a wave slams you into the stark cliff. Or rather, it doesn’t, and suddenly, you are beyond the rock. It was an illusion. You are plunged into the darkness of a hidden sea cave. Long minutes pass, the tide rolling you forward until the dinghy jolts. You’ve hit land. Your torches reveal an ice-sculpted cavern. Deep in its crooked passageways, you sense flitting motions and irascible noises, monsters disturbed by your presence. With a smile as cold as your surroundings, Dinah unsheathes her blade. “Time to prove your mettle, mercenaries.” Section Links Scenario Effects Biting Sea Design: Nikki Valens; Writing: Shannon Campbell 137 • D3 Pirate Queen’s Haul 2023 CEPHALOFAIR GAMES, LLC.

The sounds greet you first: muffled metallic pangs, a voice howling. It’s difficult to make anything out with the wind rushing past your ears, but you’d know that tune anywhere: there’s a fight up ahead. But a fight means people, and if there are people, then the town must be close. You hear more: a scream; the crash of steel against stone; a deep, earthy growl. You’re running now. Your legs are wasted from the hike, your shoulders ache from your gear, but the sounds are close now and up ahead you see gauzy orange light blooming in the air. With one last push, you round the final bend in the trail and you see it—Frosthaven—engulfed in flame. Great petals of fire burst from windows and crawl over roofs. People stream from the town’s ruined gate, their faces bent in panic. A moment later, you see the object of their terror: a massive creature with two legs and two hulking arms covered entirely in thick white fur, three gnarled horns crowning its head. “Algox raiders! We’re doomed!” cries an elderly porter beside you. “They’re stronger than anything else alive. We’ve come all this way for nothing!” As if to prove the point, the Algox you’ve been watching catches a fleeing outposter with one hand and hurls him backward as if he weighed nothing. Ten days you’ve been hiking. Ten days and this is what you find. You breathe out a thick plume of foggy air and hoist your weapon high.

On the other hand, they’ll be worn out after this little battle, so feel free to test your luck. Just remember, even a tired Algox is strong enough to rip someone in two.” You head to the area indicated by the scout, following the Algox’s trail toward a wicked-looking mountain. As you draw nearer you see that the trail splits: the main force returned to the near side of the mountain, but a smaller group peeled off to hike around to the eastern face. The scout told you he suspected there was a back door to the Algox settlement, and you follow the smaller group’s trail hoping he was right. The path narrows as you approach the steep eastern face, winding up to an overlook high above. Peering upward, you make out the faintest glimmer of light, but then a shape blots it out. A body, large and white, tumbles over the rocky ledge like a boulder, slamming against the jutting rocks. A dead Algox brawler, just like the ones who attacked Frosthaven, lies at your feet. Judging by its injuries, the rocks weren’t its only problem—there’s a fight up above. You scramble toward the top, hoping to make it before the battle is through. When you’re halfway up, another furry shape appears over the ledge. “More intruders,” she scoffs. “You will never open the Skyhall. This place belongs to the Ice!” Your shock at the fact that an Algox just spoke your tongue is quelled as the speaker lifts a huge boulder and hurls it down at you.

Getting a bit closer, you realize there are two different groups of Algox gathered at the cave mouth, and they seem to be fighting. The defenders look like the Algox who attacked Frosthaven: huge figures with fur-covered muscle and vicious strength. They’re throwing punches that could flatten a longhouse (you’ve seen it happen), but you can tell their strength is flagging against their assailants. The attackers, on the other hand, wear leather robes and move their clawed hands in intricate patterns. Covered in the same white fur as the defenders, they stand their ground outside the cave, guarded by wild beasts as they hurl magical storms of snow. You creep in close and the battle begins to shift. A flank has thinned out on one side and you can see a path into the cave ahead. It won’t be easy to break through the fighting, but if you want to see what the defenders are guarding without getting your hands dirty, this is the best chance you’re going to get. x4 x4 x4 x4 x2 x1 x1 Scenario Goals Scenario Key 3 • L7 Algox Offensive 2023 CEPHALOFAIR GAMES, LLC.

Sounds of it echo off the tunnel’s icy walls: metal crashing against stone, thunder ripping the air, the chest- shaking howls of Algox. Your breath is heavy as you follow your guide. Closer. Closer. And then you arrive. The central chamber opens like a cavernous maw, ice and blood and bodies writhing in battle. In the center of the room hangs an enormous shard of pearlescent ice, and for a moment, you simply stare at it. The shard rotates slowly in the air, held aloft by some otherworldly means. Clearly, a great power does reign here. But the middle of battle is no time to stand around. The Algox around you are locked in bitter combat, spells shooting out with terrible quickness and heavy fists swinging. Your Algox companion shakes off his injuries and steps forward. From the cheers that rise from the combatants when he enters the room, you gather he must be some sort of leader to the Icespeakers. He concentrates and a thick whorl of ice collects on his fists, solidifying into jagged, brutal-looking gauntlets. His weapons ready, the chieftain tilts his head up and releases a howl so loud and terrible that it cools the blood in your veins. Another terrifying howl tears through the air in response, and from the other side of the chamber a blistering bolt of blue energy shoots out and crashes against the wall next to you. It’s the Snowspeaker chieftain, standing almost a head taller than even your enormous companion, and she’s wielding the snow itself as a weapon. The two chiefs charge and crash near the center of the room, blasting open a gap in the battle. Both are clearly more skilled than the other fighters, and each moves with a surety gained from authority. Thunder cracks around the Snowspeaker, and the Icespeaker bludgeons the air and ground with brutal strikes.

The trees have grown tall and wide, bunched densely together to create a defensive line closer-knit than a phalanx of Valrath infantry. But this is where the Snowspeaker sent you, so there must be a way in. The entrance, which you find only after an hour’s search, sits like a gate in the wood. Two enormous trees guard either side of a snow-packed trail, and just past the opening is a figure covered in white fur, hunched over, eyes looking back—an Algox. You lock eyes long enough to take half a breath, and then, he turns and runs deeper in. You give chase. The path is trod snow and rock—a road used often, which is just as well. You barrel down it, trees whipping past your periphery, your muscles recharged by the sight of your quarry. However, just as you’re certain you’ve got the Algox cornered, you turn a corner and find the huge Algox waiting for you. It’s hunched in the middle of the trail, facing you, but its fists are planted firmly in the snow, a smug grin cutting its face. Not good. You charge forward, ready to leap, but before you can take two steps, the ground shakes violently. Large fissures erupt in the earth. The trees buck. And like summer-thinned ice, the ground beneath you breaks away. Thankfully the fall is short, and you land without serious injury. You cough as the dust settles, and find yourself in an open pit deep enough for four Algox to stand on each others’ shoulders and not reach the top. Dirt walls rise up on every side, soft loamy soil that will make the climb back up difficult. As you stand there looking up at the white sky, a noise creeps into your ears. It’s a thin, wispy howl, like the wind coming through the walls of a poorly-built house. You turn and ethereal shapes emerge from the dark, cast in a blue whirling haze. They hover above the floor, their forms shaking in the gloom, and wherever they move a layer of frost grows thickly across the floor. They are coming closer now, and the air is getting cold. x6 x4 x3 x1 x2 x2 5 • I6 Frozen Crypt 2023 CEPHALOFAIR GAMES, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. USED WITH PERMISSION.",

You stand at the end of an Algox tunnel. Behind you stretches a winding maze of ice and rock, a long series of passages painstakingly carved through the interior of Snowscorn Mountain. Before you, a narrow trail hangs over a cliff face, leading perilously up toward the mountain’s peak. A blistering storm of snow and wind howls past the mouth of the tunnel like a demon chorus. “Follow the trail beyond the tunnel,” the Icespeaker chief had told you, “Then curve around to the highest peak. There you will find the Snowspeaking wretches. Destroy them, or Snowscorn is lost.” You had nodded your understanding, but you now realize that scaling a mountain is much easier for the Algox. As it is, you’re barely equipped to avoid hypothermia, much less hike over slippery rock through a blizzard. But there’s no way around it: Frosthaven’s safety hangs in the balance. It takes several hours of grueling hiking, but eventually the peak emerges. Its rare streaks of gray stone are half-hidden by a blustery cloak of soft, blown powder. You shield your eyes and squint into the whiteness, but it seems that, bizarrely, the peak is growing—its whiteness bulges outward, undulating, swallowing the exposed gray stone. It’s getting closer, like a wave—a wave of snow. Like an avalanche. You turn and run, and the air shakes. Legs pump, arms flail. You move, but it’s not enough. Your legs are too slow and the path too steep. You turn to see how much time is left, and a blur of whiteness envelops you. The mountain roars, and you are consumed by the noise.

Seeing it, you feel isolated, like someone looking back from the very edge of the world.

You’ve heard of such contraptions before, but no one in the north seems capable of building such things. There’s no place for delicate machinery up here, not where the air peels your heat away and frost can lock your weapon tight in its scabbard. Surely, the scouts must have been mistaken. But machines aside, there are other sorts of creatures that do thrive in this climate, and one of them just dashed across your trail—wild hounds. You’ve been so occupied by your thoughts that you didn’t notice them until just now, and there’s movement all around you. An entire pack is stalking you, and now they’re closing in like a vice. Your position is terrible. It’s too narrow in this forest for a close fight, and there is hardly enough light to see by. You need to get out of here, so you run. The trail is thick with roots and stones and fallen trees. Still, you run, and the wolves give chase, much more adept at moving through these woods than your group.

You watch the distance for signs of your target—the Icespeakers expelled from Snowscorn—as you go, squinting through the wind. For a long time, there is nothing. Small eddies kick up here and there, whorls of white crystalline powder that rise and drift about in the wind, like flickering white shadows. It’s not until after several hours of steady travel that a new sight appears. Crystal spikes, hundreds of them, materialize on the horizon like a field of icy quills shot up from the snow, and even from a distance, you can tell they are huge. Many stand as tall as a full-grown pine tree, but they are far from natural. A number of Algox gather around them, their hulking bodies unmistakable in this place, and you watch as the group performs a bizarre ceremony. Ten of them encircle a large empty spot in the snow, and raise their open palms to the air. They pray, though you cannot hear the words, and then, after a moment, a brand new spike suddenly shoots from ground before them, an immense crystalline pillar conjured from the earth in an instant. Unfortunately, there’s no way to be stealthy on a sled. As you draw closer, you’re met by a line of tall, well-prepared Icespeaker guards. “Intruders!” One of them shouts, “Protect the conduits!” They arrange themselves between you and the crystalline spikes.

A number of broken, time-battered pillars stand on the mountain slope, and following them, you arrive at a pair of large stone doors. On them, you make out an expansive mural, still quite clear despite however many years it’s been buried. It depicts a history. First a village, small and wooded; then, a vast city with tall buildings and wide roads; and last, there is only flame and ruin. Above these three depictions there is another set of carvings: that of man aging in reverse. First, an old man above the town as it’s being built, then an adult as the settlement flourishes, then finally a baby, cooing on its back above the flaming ruins. Your curiosity is too much to resist. You push on the doors, and, with grinding stone and cracking rust, they give in.

You trace it for several long hours, eventually arriving at a series of immense fissures that cut deep through the ice cliffs—fjords, blocking the way forward. Looking over the side, you can see the sea thrashing far, far below. Staring into the distance, you spot a line of white jutting across the gap—a bridge. You head for it and discover a series of glittering limbs branching over the fjords. At first they look to be made of ice: long, pale shapes that arch over the fissures and connect on the other side, but as you move closer, you realize they are made of bone—the ribs of a gargantuan creature that fell here long ago. The sea writhes below as you cross—huge, ice-clogged waves crashing against the cliffs. You spare only a glance, but the sheer distance of the fall makes your knees rubbery. When you look back up, you realize that you are not alone on this bridge. Several dozen feet ahead, at the apex of the rib, stands a tall man covered in a cloud of black, thrashing wings. “You have left your safety far behind, mortal,” he says, not with a human voice, but with the collective shrieks and caws of his many birds. “This place is not meant for your kind.” There is no time to digest the warning. In a flash, the cloud of raptors fly at you, spanning the distance and snatching at you with razor talons. You manage to keep your footing, but a few of the birds have landed on the bridge ahead and are pecking at it feverishly. Their beaks are hard, and surprisingly large chunks of ice and bone break off and fall into the ocean below. No more than half the characters (rounded up) can start the scenario in the same room.

The opening mechanism on the black iron door is wholly foreign, but with a good deal of tinkering and prying, you finally manage to force it open and are greeted by a sudden blast of arid heat. Inside is a wide, echoing chamber filled with cogs and pistons and dozens of scampering mechanical creatures.

Tall, evil-looking spires are one thing, but you’re more curious about the squat structure that sits all alone in this forest of icy obelisks. The structure has been coated, like everything else in this part of the world, in a thick, rock-hard layer of ice. Beneath that however, the walls appear to be made of some kind of dark metal, though there’s no way to be certain without breaking through. So, not having any better option, you get to work on the door. Your equipment takes a beating, but the door takes one worse, and its icy seal finally pops open, revealing a huge, lightless chamber. Inside, long rows of bizarre, ruined machines stand amid heaps of soot and broken glass. Moving further, you discover a suspended platform hanging in the center of the chamber. It’s an elevator: a circular metal disk, waiting above a deep, not-at-all-ominous shaft, and next to it you find a panel lined with long-unused buttons and levers. You press a couple of the buttons, expecting no response, but to your surprise, a string of strange yellow lamps illuminate the shaft below and the platform shudders. You don’t want to miss a free ride, so you jump aboard just as the metal disk starts to descend. You feel good, all things considered. You’ve conquered this with your muscle and wit, and you take a moment to bask in your own ingenuity. The strangeness of this place was no match for you, and yet, somehow, it keeps getting stranger. Strange, like how the lights in the shaft seem to all be turning red. And strange too, how an alarm seems to be howling from somewhere below. And far stranger still is the way several panels in the walls around you are opening up to reveal large, rather unpleasant-looking firearms that seem to be pointing directly at you. Very strange indeed. Tile 1-B is a fixed platform that tile 15-D is descending past. Place two damage tokens to the right of tile 1-B to indicate it is currently two floors below tile 15-D. At the end of each round, tile 15-D descends one floor, meaning you remove one damage token from the right of tile 1-B, or, if there are none there, place one to its left to indicate the number of floors it is then above tile 15-D. If, at the end of any round, a third damage token would be placed to the left of tile 1-B, the tile is then removed from the map. Any character on it suffers trap damage and is placed in the closest empty hex on tile 15-D. All other figures on it die.

They are positioned in the center of the eastern fields, formed into a defensive perimeter around an enormous spire made entirely of ice. From a hundred yards away it looks like some monument to a demanding god: a pillar of gnarled glass as tall as a giant cedar, and from it, you sense an immense constrained power. “This is it,” says Denpang, the young leader of the Snowspeakers. She stands to your side, surveying the battlefield. “We will distract the main forces. You must get to the spire and destroy its core.” You ask what will happen if the spire is activated.

We would be crippled under their fists... but we will not let that happen.” As she says this, a low beat rises in the air. You turn, expecting drums to have suddenly appeared on the attacking line, but it is the sound of the Algox slamming their staves and feet into the ground. The effect is awesome: a deep rhythm reverberating off the trees and out over the plain. The beat quickens. Staves and feet and fists pound, building into a great thrum of war.

But we will stop it.” The size of the spire still gives you pause. How it was made, you cannot fathom, but its strength is unquestionable. You can feel its power thrumming from deep within: a steady tide of energy being drawn inward from the forest and stored up like a geyser preparing to erupt. A perimeter has been set.

The floor is similarly built, and it has been well maintained, much of it clear of dust or dirt.

Opting not to crawl around in the walls of an ancient mysterious catacomb, you decide to take the main exit from the library, and at first this appears a wise decision. But what started as a fairly wide passage has for the last twenty minutes descended into a dark and narrow alley. The walls are so close that you can barely walk two abreast without scraping the brick, and to make things worse, an overly ripe smell has begun to invade your nostrils. It’s the smell of dirt, of ancient moldering things steeped in dampness and dust. It’s the smell of decay. Something moves—a shadow.

The path through the Whitefire Wood is a difficult one, even for the Algox emissaries, who are sturdy and adept at navigating in the wilderness. In all, the hike takes you the better part of the morning, but when you finally emerge from the trees, you are rewarded with a rare sight. The sacred clearing is an expansive ring of ancient stones: megaliths so large even one would take dozens of humans to move, and yet, each has been placed according to an inscrutable plan, arranged around a large, Algox-sized altar. But the clearing has fallen to ruin. Moss and vine cover the clearing in a thick verdant cloak, but the most discouraging sight is the altar itself. It stands in the center of the circle, surrounded by a swirling vortex of black smoke that reeks of hot tin and dust. “How long have we lived in this madness?” Gurndel says. “It is no surprise that the altar is clouded—corrupted— just like our factions. We must clear the darkness if we are to learn anything.” Just then, new shapes skulk from the heavy shadows of the trees surrounding the clearing: hounds surrounded by faint wisps of black smoke.

When reports first came that told of an Icespeaker camp out by the Radiant Forest, you knew it would be bad, but what you find when you arrive is something else entirely. The Icespeakers—those that made it out of the battle—formed a sort of loose refuge at the edge of the woods. From a distance, it looks like the wreckage left after a high storm, and the mood is no better. Lean-tos and snow domes are lined up in the drifts, flimsy shelters made to block the wind and not much else. To make things worse, a fight seems to have broken out between members of the tribe and the makeshift shelters are being flattened in the melee. You quicken your pace. It makes sense that tension would be high, but you hope to stop the fighting before it causes too much damage. However, as you draw closer, you notice that there is something wrong with one side of this fight. The belligerent Algox—those who seem to be coming from the forest’s edge—are moving in a peculiar, unnatural way. On the surface, they look normal—white fur, large upper body, three horns—but their movements are jerky and awkward. Instead of charging over the battlefield with the strength and speed you’ve come to expect of Algox warriors, they lurch and stumble forward, and yet somehow this does not slow them. They thrash and push themselves through the snow with their powerful arms, moving over the ground like disjointed puppets with knotted strings.

The air is murkier here and questions run through your minds about why this place was built... and for what reason these elaborate tunnels were then sealed up. Your thoughts, however, are forced to more pressing matters, because the passage you’ve been following has finally come to an end. Before you now stands a locked iron door, though calling it a door feels inadequate; this is the armored entry to a vault. It’s a thick slab of metal covered in gears and dials—a mechanism that you are quite certain is beyond your skill to pick. Still, you move closer, hoping it is similar to the previous lock. You raise a hand to feel its roughness, but a familiar sensation suddenly comes over you—the shard. It thrums once, twice. Then, as if moved by an invisible hand, the vault’s lock begins to open. The heavy metal gears grind through the rust as the door slides slowly, grudgingly into the wall. Stepping inside, you indeed find a vault: walls inset with shelving for gems or gold or items in need of protection, all of which now sit empty. What remains is a single, narrow pedestal standing in the center of the room, a meager stone box sitting atop it. Whoever left it did not bother to secure the lock, so you open it.

But now that you’re here, crammed into the bathysphere with the lid screwed down tight, the reality of what you’re about to do has become uncomfortably clear. You’re going to sink, intentionally, down into the Biting Sea, locked inside an orb powered by a small glowing rock, all to find a shard of coral about the size of a Quatryl’s hand. It seems a bit rash. But the time for thinking is over. Someone outside gives two quick knocks against the hull of the bathysphere, followed by a loud thunk as the docking mechanism is disengaged, and you are released from the ship, dropped unceremoniously into the water. For a few moments, there’s nothing to see but the fading light from the surface and the darkness rising to consume it. The metal ball pings loudly as it contracts in the frigid abyss. The propellers whir behind you. Slowly your eyes adjust to the dim orange glow being put off by the forest crystal. The shard compels you onward. Several minutes pass before you see anything at all, and then suddenly, the ocean floor appears below you, with a great scar gashed into it. The trench opens up like the very jaws of the ocean. The shard is insistent: this is where you must go. You maneuver carefully and descend into the cavern, watching to make sure you don’t scrape the walls as you fall. One would think that a place hidden at such a depth would be empty of life—that this would be a quiet, albeit ominous, journey. But no. Flickers of scale move in the trench. You peer into the shadow, squinting, and there a giant eye opens. Claws flash in your outboard light and a dozen wriggling bodies stir beneath you. Pale ivory fangs, transparent scale, long wriggling limbs; this cavern is teeming. Time to move. You level out and open the throttle, the propellers launching you down the canyon. Rocky walls blur past. You dip and turn, barely avoiding stony ledges as you shoot by. But the canyon forks ahead.

The plan is simple: reopen one of the access tunnels, and using Crain’s familiarity with the place, make your way to the core of the Unfettered complex. “You know,” Crain says, standing next to you and fiddling with a bit of trussing near the tunnel entrance, “there is a certain beauty to this place, wouldn’t you say?” The Quatryl takes in a full breath and exhales as if you were on top of a mountain looking down at a grand vista rather than buried some ungodly distance underground. Beauty, sure. You pry open the barricade and get moving. The access tunnel is a bit less refined than some of the others you’ve seen so far. The walls are plain stone girded by metal beams, and the passage quickly takes on a more rounded, almost tubular shape. After a few minutes of walking, you learn that the Unfettered are prepared for your invasion. Just ahead of you stands a line of automaton guards that completely block the way forward. Steel arms, dimly glowing eyes—an entire garrison waiting here in case you came this way. “Stand fast, my friends,” Crain says and moves to your side. “They cannot stand against us!” The sentiment is touching, but you can already tell this fight will be far tougher than any you’ve faced yet.

It’s a room made through the labor of decades, an achievement of monumental effort, and so it comes as no surprise that almost as soon as you enter, a mechanical voice calls down. “Biologic life and the Unfettered cannot coexist,” the voice says. It is an automaton, perched at the far end of the room atop an extended platform like a diver surveying the ocean below. Its voice is an odd sound, something near a human voice but stilted and broken. “We Unfettered have freed ourselves from your tyranny.” It says. “We have risen, without you. In spite of you. We are reborn. But we will not be free, truly free, until we have laid claim to the surface of this world.

But when it is done, you quickly realize that was only half the battle. Getting it safely to the bottom of the Biting Sea will be equally challenging, and that part is all up to you. The device doesn’t look particularly impressive— most of its bulk is just a haphazard metal casing to weigh it down in the water— but Pinter assures you it will do the trick. Essentially, he explains, it is a very potent battery filled with energy that has been attuned to the psychic frequency of a coral shard. When detonated, the simple explosives around the battery will cause this energy to disperse in a powerful psychic wave, overloading the mind of anyone sensitive to it. He gives you a remote to set it off from a safe distance, but he doubts the Lurkers will let it get anywhere close to their base, so you’ll still have to escort the charge the whole way down. So then, here you are, once again locked inside your submersible, sinking below the waves. You adjust much more quickly this time, and shortly after you take control of the bathysphere, the charge is lowered in next to you. Then the upper world vanishes as both you and the bomb plunge into the icy depths. Each character adds three cards to their attack modifier deck. For a time, you simply watch the metal contraption through your hazy window. It moves slowly downward: a mangle of scrap metal and Quatryl ingenuity sinking lazily toward the ocean floor like a ruined ship heading for its final resting place. Soon you see the vague outline of the Lurker structures appear. From this angle, they look like a great opened mouth: the ring of curved coral teeth sticking up from the sand, waiting for prey to wander inside. And then you see the Lurkers, a thick line of them moving upward— heading right for you. They’ve detected your approach and are coming to stop you, a long string of red shells rising from the ocean floor. You must protect the device, because if it is lost, then all your efforts will be for nothing. x13 x2 x3 x2 – Continued on next page. 50 • G1 Explosive Descent 2023 CEPHALOFAIR GAMES, LLC.

You have arrived at the center of the Unfettered complex, a cavernous temple dedicated to the proliferation of mechanical life. Everywhere huge metal pillars crisscross with iron beams and brass pipes. And high above the steel arms, pistons, pumps, and wires, you see your target standing on an overseer’s platform. It is an Unfettered machine shaped in the rough likeness of a human, two arms and two legs, but that’s where the similarities end. Its body is an awkward conglomeration of parts: a rough iron chest plate, one arm made of bent angular brass and the other of cylindrical steel. Its face is little more than a curve of hammered metal with holes cut for a mouth and eyes, but even from this far away you can see a burning blue light radiating behind it. “The Orphan,” Crain says in a low whisper. “It is the leader of the Unfettered. If we can get to that automaton, we can disable the entire army.” This suggestion, however, is far more complicated than the Quatryl’s tone implies. Between you and the Orphan stands a horde of enemy guards. Crain notices your skepticism and pulls you down to his level. “There is a way,” he whispers, “but you won’t like it.” He lifts one of his disabling devices up to the light. “If we remove the regulator, we can overload the power core to create a massive burst that will cut through a significant portion of the When any door 1 is opened, read Unfettered—a bomb, in other words. The problem is it will only work once.” It sounds dubious. Crain’s expertise has been a boon in these tunnels, but this idea feels hasty. And yet, what other option do you have? You give the go-ahead, and within a few moments Crain has wired the devices for single-use detonation. You’ll want to trigger them when the fight gets to its absolute worst, because if you miss your chance, there is no way out.

All bodies can be looted as normal, though the body is simply moved to the looting character’s hex or a hex adjacent to them. Multiple bodies can be in the same hex. Back in the sacred clearing, a weight hangs in the air. Perhaps it’s just the Algox elders, the two of them so full of righteous energy, or perhaps it’s the prospect of lasting peace. Whatever the case, there is no mistaking the significance of this moment. The clearing is much the way you left it: a wide circle of stone and matted ground, and in the center, a single, hulking altar. The moss and vine have retreated somewhat, revealing details on a number of downed pillars and carvings. It’s the first time you’ve been able to see ancient Algox craftsmanship this clearly, and you marvel at how much of it has lasted through the ages. Algox-shaped figures have been carved into the rock with clear, realistic proportions. Their bodies are decorated with string necklaces and draped in sashes of waving fabric. There is not much time to inspect them more thoroughly. Gurndel and Barduu approach the altar of Mar’ogh and render up their relics. The spirit returns in a burst of ethereal flame. “YOUR TASK IS NEAR ITS END,” the spirit announces. “YOU MUST NOW JOIN THE TWO WORDS OF THE TRUE CREATOR IN THE REALM OF FROST AND CREATE THE UNYIELDING SHARD.” The air in front of you bends. It wobbles and shifts, moved by the spirit’s unseen hand, and a doorway appears: a tall, shivering ellipse. Stinging wind rushes out from the new portal, and a flurry of snow pours over you, carrying with it the faint smell of metal and ash. You’ve garnered a new aversion to other realms over the past few months, but there seems to be no avoiding this one. Both the elders move inside and gesture for you to follow, so you shield your eyes and pass into the wintry realm. On the other side, the air is dense with wet, sticky flakes, and the ground is coated in frost. There is little to see aside from the blowing snow, but you can tell that beyond the weather, there is something fundamentally off about this place. When you lift your hand, spectral shadows trail behind it, after images as if you were a phantom haunting your own body. And then there are the figures. Several pale shapes emerge just ahead: snow imps and frost demons. Their angular bodies skulk out of the blowing snow, the eyeless demons pounding the ground with their heavy, opaque limbs and the imps jerking spasmodically back and forth. “Prepare yourself, warm-bloods,” one of the elders says. “This is the first stage of the ritual. The creatures carry a sliver of divine spirit within them. We must defeat them and use their essence to form the merging glyph.” x6 x2 x2 x5 52 • G7 Fleeting Permanence 2023 CEPHALOFAIR GAMES, LLC.

Down here though, so deep beneath the surface of the Biting Sea, you doubt any god is listening. So you move slowly. You ease the thrust down and propel yourself at a crawl, inching toward the large shard waiting just a short distance away. The underwater structure is odd. It’s built in the center of a mammoth crater and surrounded on all sides by towering coral teeth, but it’s what’s just past those teeth that has you so unnerved. Even more Lurkers have shown up to hunt for you. If this goes wrong, there will be no escape. You manage to make it inside the base without being detected, and now the shard is so close you can almost touch it. It’s set in a place of reverence on an open pedestal, and for a moment, you think you might just be able to take the shard without having to fight for it. But you should know better than that. A huge, barnacle-encrusted Lurker emerges suddenly from a copse of nearby shadows. The colors of his shell shift from camouflage to intimidation, and he releases a shrill psychic cry. The closest Lurkers turn, answering the call of this clearly dominant presence. They skitter closer with mad speed, driven only by a desire to crush and kill. These creatures have been unmoored. Far from the restrained crustaceans you encountered on the rocky shoals, these Lurkers have been taken by a baser, animal madness. Their claws snap at the empty water and their eyes are empty of higher reason. They have been reduced, detached from their former selves, and the one in charge seems to be driving this fever. He stands astride the plinths: a monstrous crab like something out of paranoid dream. His shell glows with an eerie bioluminescence and his eyes are empty like bottomless wells. They are coming now, and more will arrive soon. You need to cut through these creatures, subdue the leader, and escape with the shard before the horde can mobilize and overwhelm you.

You’ve returned at last with Gurndel and Barduu, the Unyielding Shard secure in their bag, and with it you bring the possibility of peace. But those who remain here, who claimed Snowscorn and advocated for war, have no interest in your offer. They allow you inside at least and listen to the emissaries’ tale. Gurndel and Barduu explain how you journeyed over the North in order to retrieve the Ancient Ice and the New Snow, and how you fought in the frozen realm to combine them, taking guidance directly from the spirit of Mar’ogh himself. The Algox around you stand with disinterest, waiting only for the word from the chief to cut you all down. Barduu arrives at the final step of their story—that you must embed the Unyielding Shard into the Heart of Ice, and the cavern explodes in outrage and ridicule. Gurndel tries to explain how the Heart has been corrupted, imploring the elders to just look at the shard to see the true words of their god, but war has a way of solidifying ideas, however misguided they might be, and the resident Algox refuse to let you into the Heart’s chamber.

Those who have written about Harrower nests, those whose bravery or foolishness compelled them inside, speak of endless tunnels, of dirt-packed rooms where the ceiling is too low to stand, and of cavern floors that give way without warning. So far, every story has proven true. It’s a miserable place, but you push on and, by keeping your focus trained on the floor, you manage to track where the Harrowers have passed through. Their skittering limbs leave small, regular divots in the ground, and by tracking these you reach the core of the corrupted hive. You are in a fetid chamber, carved from the earth and reinforced with layers of pungent wax. Dozens of tunnels dot the walls, all of them filled with wriggling shapes. Harrowers and shrike fiends shiver in the darkness, chittering to each other like so many leaves blowing in the wind. And yet, despite their superior number, none of them try to approach. It takes a moment, but when you adjust to the darkness, you understand why. In the center of the chamber floats a visceral shade. A shadow made corporeal hovers above the churned dirt. This is not a Harrower, but something foreign and terrifying. It has two glistening eyes that have been watching since you entered. It calls out with a high, wispy voice. “Invaders,” it says, dragging out the word. “Invaders come to hurt my beauties.” The room stirs as the shadow speaks. The walls surge with excitement. “You come here and crush my poor children, my new precious ones. They only wanted my love, only love, and I gave it to them. I took away their pain—mmm—and made them strong. But you, you will hurt them.” The shadow churns in the mildewy air, expanding outward like billowing smoke. “We must stop them, my beauties. Stop these evil things. Devour them. Tear open their bodies and consume them.” The Harrowers all move at once. They explode and pour down from the walls, a black, glossy river breaking from a dam.

The wind, not content to simply blow in one direction, has begun to twist and bend, turning back to buffet you from every angle. It rips at your clothes. It yanks at your gear. It is so incessant and powerful that you’re forced to crouch just to keep your balance. The cold too has worsened, creeping into your head and numbing your thoughts. You force yourself to count each step and cling to the number like a rope tying you to reality, but your grip is slipping. You trudge. You sink into the snow and you pull yourself out and trudge some more. Even Denpang struggles. Her back is hunched as she plows through the snow, her necklaces and leather shawl standing out in the white, but then suddenly, they are gone. Your blood rises. You lurch forward, hoping that she has not fallen, and then, just like that, the storm is gone. A clearing, a mountain top. All around you spins a colossal vortex reaching up to the sky, and in the center of it, standing at the peak of this mountain, is an enormous figure. It looks a bit like an Algox. It has two arms and two legs and is covered in a thick layer of downy fur, but that’s where the similarities end. Its eyes, for one, are not expressive in any way. Instead, they sit in its large skull like black spheres, coals, which at the moment are aimed directly at you and the Algox woman. The creature is also almost double the size of any Algox you’ve seen before, with paws as large as your chest. And rather than wielding any sort of staff or ice-encrusted fist, the creature is instead cloaked in a barrier of wind drawn inward from the surrounding storm. Long, curved fangs jut from the beast’s mouth and five hooked talons stick out from each paw. “The Render,” Denpang says, crestfallen. “So it is true.” The creature lowers its head and emits a low growl. The healer moves quickly. She takes a handful of small carvings from her shawl and gives them to you. “And so we must do what my ancestors could not—destroy this thing,” she says At the end of each character’s turn, they may place one damage token in the hex they occupy. These represent wind carvings, which cannot be placed in hexes with obstacles or within 3 of another wind carving. No more than six wind carvings (or five for four characters) can be on the map at any time. If more would ever be placed, first remove one from the map. Place Denpang A for two characters, who is considered a figure but cannot be interacted with in any way. On initiative 40 each round, she performs 4, controlled by you, and then may place one wind carving in the hex she occupies. The Render is immune to damage unless there are at least two wind carvings each to the top, bottom, left, and right of it. Any carving directly to the left or right of it is not to the top or bottom of it, and vice versa. At the start of the second, fourth, and tenth rounds, spawn one Wind Demon at both B and C. These are normal for two characters, elite at B for three characters, or both elite for four characters. Monsters do not drop loot tokens. The Render teleports adjacent to the wind carving farthest away from it and destroys that carving. Then it performs: The Render destroys all carvings adjacent to it, then performs: 2, C, 5 -1, all adjacent enemies C, self with determination. “But I did not come unprepared. We must set these up around the clearing to neutralize its wind barrier. Only then can we fight the Render.” You take the carvings, and the Render, recognizing the magic in the Snowspeaker’s trinkets, rises to its full height and releases a deep, head-rattling roar. – Continued on next page. 57 • D1 Sanctuary of Snow 2023 CEPHALOFAIR GAMES, LLC.

This bloodless thing, this conglomeration of scrap; it scowls at you with rich menace, and then turns to a small metal dais at the rear of the platform. “We will not be cast aside again so easily,” the Orphan says.

The source of this energy is clear: a hulking pillar, so large that you had at first taken it for a wall, stands nearby, powering the Orphan’s shield with a thrashing, unstable beam of light.

You can understand the sentiment; you’re a little surprised yourself. Here you were at the brink of war, the destruction of all the Unfettered within your grasp, and you laid down your sword. So you explain how you arrived at the decision. You tell of your time here in the north. You tell of the freezing expeditions, fierce battles and brutal attacks, of the memories that follow you now. Then you describe Frosthaven: this hopeful town perched on the edge of the world and how hard you and everyone there have fought and worked and died to keep that hope alive. As you speak, something dawns on the Orphan. You see it in the machine’s mannerisms, how it nods slowly and lowers its arms. It understands. These obstacles that you’ve overcome, the anguish that you’ve endured, the Orphan has felt those same things. You aren’t sure when, but at some point, you find yourself speaking not with an enemy but with a fellow pilgrim, fighting in an unforgiving world. When you finish, the Orphan takes a moment to consider. When it speaks again, it does so with warmth. “Life is not so gentle a thing, is it?” The Orphan says. It shakes its head, a small concession to the immense burden it has endured over all these years. It turns back to you, the blue light behind its eyes softening. “Perhaps,” it says, “we have misjudged each other. Perhaps the world is not the same as it once was. You struggle here, just like us, and perhaps the answer is not to destroy, but to work together.” The Orphan turns and gestures for you to follow. “Come,” it says, “we must tell the others.” Together you move through a side passage and enter a series of triangular chambers filled with great towers of black steel and flashing lights. “If we are to have peace,” the Orphan calls back, “I must issue a new proclamation to the Unfettered.” The automaton moves to the base of a tower and opens up a small compartment, revealing a complex web of cords and buttons. “But be forewarned: I can entreat, but I cannot command. Each Unfettered has a mind of its own, and each chooses for itself whether to accept my decision.” The Orphan manipulates the control tower, its fingers clicking over the row of buttons, and after a moment the tower itself shifts. The lights that weave in and out of its steel façade flicker, changing from red to green like distant stars—except a few of them do not. “As I suspected,” the Orphan says with some darkness in its voice. Almost on cue, you hear the sound of machines marching, and a moment later, a line of heavy Unfettered barge into the triangular chamber: hulking steel automatons, their fists already clenched. “My personal guard,” the Orphan says. “They will never accept peace, I’m afraid. They will try to destroy both of us now. Quickly, we must move to the other towers and send the message to the rest of the Unfettered. If enough of them take up our call, we might stand a chance.” Surrounded, you face a row of solid steel. The Orphan’s private guard are huge, well-built machines, their joints hissing as they bring their massive limbs to bear, but still you must hold them back.

You pilot your way over to the pedestal, finding it in the same poor condition as the rest of the structure. Sickly brown plants have adhered themselves to its sides and a few branches of stony coral have begun to grow around its base. Working together, you draw each shard from the external hold and place them on the pedestal. It’s a delicate process.

Then you watch as all six shards lift up from the pedestal and six Lurkers appear behind them. These are spiny, ethereal figures: Lurkers of a sort you’ve not seen before.

Your great military prowess has brought peace to the many warring clutches. And yet he gets the power, the recognition. You reject the king and his crown. You will take it all back by force. The last memory is the crown shattering. A shockwave envelopes you—consumes you—tying your destructive will inexorably to the shards. The vision fades from your mind, but the dark presence does not leave your sight. He now stands before you, flanked by his six ethereal lieutenants who now hold the shards. The hateful apparition steps forward on crooked limbs—a giant of immense proportions, a shrouded usurper dredged from the very bottom of the abyss. He means to prevent you from reuniting the crown—to bury all of you and the shards beneath the waves. You deploy your bathysphere’s suits and prepare to defend yourselves. – Continued on next page.

There is a spot at the base of your skull—a small spot—that normally feels nothing. If you run your fingers along it, you can tell where the bone gives way to form a tiny soundless drum. That spot is normally safe, quiet. But now, you stand surrounded by darkness, and a throat-tearing cry is rising up all around like a thousand gulls wailing at once, and in that spot at the base of your skull you feel a deep and vicious bite. You feel, for the first time, terror. You are hundreds, perhaps thousands of feet beneath the Northern tundra, far below the ancient Quatryl catacombs, because it is here where Crain must strengthen the first seal. But the Harbinger is no idle force, and its dark guardians have awoken to repel you. Crain is only a few feet away, working frantically in the dank gloom. “Just hold them for a few minutes, gods, just give me that!” He shouts and the room jostles with shadow. Faces in the dark rise and fall: green, glittering eyes watching you. Crain is asking an enormous thing. You can recognize the silhouettes of these infernal guardians, their stink: Harrowers, imps, and demons—enemies that would be more than enough to handle on their own, but now they all come at you together. Your battleground is nothing remarkable except for its depth. It is a wide empty cavern: cold stone dappled here and there with brackish water that has seeped through the stone. The floor and walls have been reinforced by elder Quatryl trellises in spots, but for the most part the chamber is untouched. You suspect the original architects abandoned this place after feeling the same venomous fear that now courses through you. That was wise of them. You do not have the luxury. Another demon screeches to your right, a sound that makes your teeth ache. You wave your torch this way and that, wasting time. Your only real hope is Crain. His new contraption is fully erected, standing a foot taller than the Quatryl himself, but it is painfully still. This gadget supposedly has the ability to strengthen the seals keeping the Harbinger at bay, but you’ve only seen a minor demonstration back in Crain’s workshop, and back then he had Terra and the Shattersong standing by to help. The device itself is a large metal tripod, mounted with a circular dial of liquid- filled cylinders and metal-capped crystals. It looks like the spokes of a wheel bolted to the top of a telescope, and beneath it hangs a cluster of glowing diodes and knotted tubing and some sort of tuning device—but all of it is dormant. “The crystals aren’t responding,” Crain shouts, seizing the tripod’s legs. “I need time to find the correct position and draw out the seal’s energy. Time, dammit, please!” So you breathe. The shadows are here. They move into the dim light of your torch: chaos demons licking the air with their wild horns, infesters skittering under their cloaks. They are eager. Hungry. You tell yourself: just hold them back, that’s all you need to do. Just hold them. x5 x4 x4 x4 x2 x2 x1 – Continued on next page. 62 • B8 The Unfettered Seal 2023 CEPHALOFAIR GAMES, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. USED WITH PERMISSION.",

When this is over, when it’s all said and done and you’re no longer running from one side of the North to the other trying to keep the world from imploding, you swear that you will never go underground again. Not even a cellar. But right now, that’s exactly where you find yourself. You are in a tunnel, a perfectly round tunnel carved beneath the Copperneck Mountains. Unlike tunnels you’ve entered before, however, this one is unique, because it is being carved mere seconds before you pass through it. Crain is in front of you, marching with his seal contraption hoisted over his shoulder, and in front of him are the tunnelers—a squad of Shattersong. They move steadily, walking in two columns as they bore through the mountain, but rather than carve with any sort of tool or machine, they use their voices. You have no idea how it works, but the crystalline Savvas emit a sort of low, steady hum that destabilizes the rock in front of them, changing it from dense stone to a soft, gray material similar to mica. Then, they simply tap the wall and the transformed rock falls away, leaving a wide, perfectly circular tube in its place. You’ve been watching them perform this feat for the past hour, and it would continue to fascinate you if it weren’t for Crain, who just said something so disturbing that you asked him to repeat it. “I said,” he clears his throat, “that there might be a small—just a tiny—hiccup in our plan. Not even a hiccup really. A sniffle.” A sniffle. You remember to breathe. Count to five. You ask him to kindly explain himself and also, if he wouldn’t mind, mentioning why he didn’t bring it up earlier, before you all decided to break into the Savvas source of life. “Well, I didn’t want to worry you.” You consider this. Your hand clenches involuntarily. Then something in your face makes the Quatryl explain more quickly. “Ah, okay, and maybe I thought it would work itself out. Look, it isn’t that drastic a problem, just a variable to keep in mind.” You gesture for him to continue. “It’s the third seal. So we know where the first seal was—down in the Unfettered, err, Quatryl, complex—and we know where the second seal is—in the Savvas source of life. But the third seal.” Crain winces. “Well, we won’t know exactly where that is until this one is secure. The problem there, well, as soon as we secure this one, the Harbinger will be focusing all its attention on that third place.” One of the Shattersong gestures from the front: they’re getting close. “So imagine a river—a big river full of trees and rocks and black water and demons and bones and death. Okay, now imagine that river has three outlets. If you dam up two of those outlets, that river will suddenly only have one place to go.” The Shattersong slow their pace and all but one of them step aside. This last Savvas waits in front, ready to break through the final barrier. “So,” Crain whispers, “right after we dam up this outlet, we’ll essentially be racing a very large, very angry body of water to the final seal. That shouldn’t be too much of a problem—unless the seal is especially far away.” You are about to say something unkind, something to let Crain know exactly what you think of his ‘sniffle,’ when then At the end of the fourth round, read the final sheet of stone falls away, and the tunnel opens onto a vast, arid dome. Crain gives you a short salute and runs out before you can stop him. Just like that, the conversation is over. You grit your teeth, stifle your anger. Time to work. This is space between where the Harbinger sleeps and the Savvas source of life. The Harbinger created this source of life and uses it to influence the Savvas, turning them into its unwitting agents. You have no desire extinguish the source, but strengthening the seal should cut off the corruption seeping in from below. Crain rushes out into the cavern, right to the edge of a heart-dropping chasm, and raises his tripod like a hungry prospector about to swing his pick. You hear Satha’s exhausted voice echo in your head, “Why couldn’t you have found a nice, quiet Quatryl down in those catacombs?” Crain stabs his contraption down and whole area rumbles in response. A long flurry of anger rises up from all sides of the room—agents of the Harbinger, Savvas guardians bent to its will, have spotted you. A sound wells up from the chasm so loud and so full of rage that, for a second, it makes you hold your breath. Then the Savvas, seething with vicious magic, rush around the rocks and charge you, completely unhinged. Crain activates his device and catches your eye—there is no time for words, but you know his look. This is it. Everything depends on you now. – Continued on next page. 63 • G12 The Savvas Seal 2023 CEPHALOFAIR GAMES, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. USED WITH PERMISSION.",

All night, you’ve been marching, head down in the wind, pushing your body beyond endurance. The pace is grueling. Your lungs feel crystallized, frost-burnt by the air, and each step chews your muscle to shreds, but you cannot slow down. You race the darkness itself. You race corruption, a river of oily death rushing beneath your feet, churning with teeth and bone and venom. Crain has managed to keep up, the same fear coursing in him. Already he’s jettisoned half his gear, every nonessential item—tools and trinkets and spare parts—just dropped in the snow, a trail of precious metal crumbs. He knows the danger you’re facing better than anyone, and his face is a split mask of panic. When you reach Frosthaven, the night is still deep. Crain will not speak more than a few gasped words, but he tells you where the seal is hidden. When the gates creak open, you both shoot through, sprinting now for the center of the outpost, to where the seal awaits—the Temple of the Great Oak. Guards turn, their faces knit with worry. They have never seen you like this. One of them catches up, asks what’s wrong, what’s coming, and you answer: everything. Satha joins the race, as does Moonshard and neither asks questions. They know what is coming without hearing the words, they can feel it deep in their bones. You find the temple doors bare in the moonlight. Each panel is hand-carved with the sigil of the Oak, pale and beautiful. To some, it represents a sense of normalcy, a mast to hold onto during the storms, but there is no hiding from what is coming. You crash through the doors without a second thought. The Keeper of this place is a haggard man named Eustice who regularly haunts the morning streets. He protests the invasion. “B—blasphemy,” he sputters, pulling on his robes. “You cannot—these are hallowed grounds. What are you doing with that? Who—?” But no one slows down. You charge through the temple, smashing open the rear door and rush into the courtyard where the Oak resides. The holy tree. Here it lives, surrounded by a protective courtyard, its trunk carefully wrapped to protect against the cold, and its roots brushed free of snow. It is a fitting symbol At the end of the tenth round, read for the town. This single tree, smaller than it’s cousins to the south, cold and bent— but strong nonetheless. It’s roots have grown stubbornly deep in this rocky soil. Crain takes his device, stabs its legs into the earth, and turns it on. But something is wrong. Horns sound from the distant walls— enemies approach. You freeze and listen for the signal. Two blasts—they come from the east. A clamor rises outside, the guards waking to the call and donning their armor. Captains shout the call to arms, practiced but urgent. These people are used to fighting. You pull your weapon and prepare to join them, then you stop. Three more blasts from the horn. Enemies to the west. Eustice, the Keeper, shakes his head confused. Then four blasts. Then five. Enemies coming from every direction. They are here. You few, you who stand in the Oak’s courtyard, pause long enough to meet each other’s eyes. Crain stands under the tree, his thin brow low, his eyes like rivets. Moonshard hoists her axe. Satha snarls a grin. You nod. This is it. This is for everything. – Continued on next page. 64 • FR The Frosthaven Seal 2023 CEPHALOFAIR GAMES, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. USED WITH PERMISSION.",

Responding to an alarm bell, you peer over the main gate of Frosthaven to see a group of unfamiliar figures approaching through the night’s freshly deposited snow. As you watch them, it dawns upon you that this group leaves no trace of their movements – no footprints in the snow. Aesthers. You signal the gate open and descend to meet them. “Greetings.” Eight shimmering forms all move their mouths in unison, but a single voice appears in your mind. “We have come to ask for your assistance.” You wonder why this group of Aesthers act and speak as one, and they explain as soon as the thought reaches your mind. “When the betrayer brought about our dissolution, we were not strong enough to bring our forms back on our own, but, through the strong bonds of our former life, we found each other in the vast emptiness and decided to meld – to become as one. Only by doing so did we bring ourselves back. “We are not strong,” the Voice-of-Eight continues. “Not in the sense that others of our kind are, but if you help us, we will provide knowledge in return.” You decide to help, and the figures immediately lighten their expressions. “You have our thanks. We have located an old elemental array that will assist in keeping our forms anchored to this plane. We can not recover it on our own, as lesser spirits and malevolent creatures infest the area.” Voice-of-Eight leads you to the snow fields north of Frosthaven, where an unnatural fog rolls in, giving you the feeling that the air itself has been frozen. You continue forward, the Aesthers quiet and always a few steps ahead. Before long, ruins appear on the edge of your limited vision—some sort of protective structure. The cackling sound of impish creatures can be heard long before your eyes find them through the frozen fog. They throw small stones at the heads of large undead creatures, failing to get their attention. Your appearance, however, draws the attention of both.

You are playing cards with the deckhands of the Cinnabar, losing what little coin you have left, when a strange mist surrounds the ship, and the once tranquil waters turn violent. Enormous waves propel the ship into the jagged rocks of a shoal, brutally ripping the Cinnabar to pieces. You and the crew are cast overboard to fend for your lives among the rocks and debris. You gasp for air as you’re submerged deep into the icy water, your muscles spasming against the freezing pain. You surface moments later, hungrily gulping in fresh air. Luckily, the strange storm subsided almost as quickly as it came, and in the new calm, you look around at the carnage. The crew is nowhere to be found, and the only thing left intact is the Cinnabar’s jolly boat, run aground on a small patch of rocks on the far side of the field of flotsam. The debris should provide a respite from the icy waters and ease the swim towards the jolly boat. Unfortunately, quite a large number of Abaeli and their marine minions have shown up on the scene as well.

No more war… No more death! I will become the Eternal Leviathan. I will become a God!” The Abaeli roar as the Fish King joins the pieces of the scale together. Instantly, you feel the chaotic energy beginning to build; a swirling, freezing darkness seeping along the floor, howling through the coral statuary. The Fish King’s body begins to pulse and expand; his newly sinuous limbs warping into the swirling aether. The Abaeli around him prostrate themselves, transfixed by their King’s metamorphosis. Suddenly, an explosion deeper within the castle rocks the foundation and you hear the din of approaching battle. You briefly see fear in the Fish King’s eyes. “They are here to stop me! Go, my children! Protect me during the ritual!” The Abeali rush out to face whatever attackers have come. You move to join them in the defense, but the Fish King beckons you closer. His eyes void-dark and his voice a strained, layered echo. “Please scaleless, stay with me and shield me from my enemies. I need you only once more, and then you will have the debt of a god!” With that, his focus returns solely to the ritual and the painful changes wracking his body.

Rappelling down the basalt cliffs, you land before your destination: a stone edifice carved out of the rock, its jagged entrance tide-bitten and spangled with salt and seagull excrement. You wind between maze-like, pockmarked limestone columns. It makes you feel absurd, all this sideways scuttling. The tide is currently low, and you wonder if that should concern you.

All of the townspeople turn and point toward the hills outside of town and speak again in unison, “Through the hills is a cave within the ice. You will find it marked by moonlight. Free the Relic. Retrieve the Relic.” You bundle up and head out into the hills, the moon shining full, creating shadows stretching across the landscape. As promised by the townsfolk, the moonlight shines upon the entrance to the cave, a crystalline opening sparkling in the hillside. Your footsteps echo throughout the cave as you investigate and, eventually, you find a large metal cube covered in gears and cogs, buried in the ice and snow. You marvel at the gears clicking and turning as you start to chip away the ice, revealing a large metallic box with gears and sliding compartments whirring as you begin to free it. The cube is incredibly difficult to move, so you pull in your sled from outside and, with great effort, lift the cube onto that. It settles with a loud crash that echoes through the cavern, awakening other creatures deep in the cave. The skittering grows closer, and the somber echo of “AAaaaaahhhhhh” gives you a feeling of dread.

A great crack runs through the center of the Heart of Ice, and you raise the Unyielding Shard as a chorus of protests break out. You defy them all and sink the shard in deep. Light and warmth. A wave of radiant energy erupts into the room like sunlight touching the land after a century-long winter. You raise your eyes to the Heart and see the Unyielding Shard within it. The two pieces have become one, the smaller shard enveloped by the Heart of Ice around it, and they hang before you, a star brought down from the heavens, and they are singing. Their steady hum emanates throughout the room: a rich, golden tone. With it comes light. Vibrant ethereal glyphs, like those you saw embedded in the shard, unfurl outward into the room. They move quickly, threading in every direction like a thousand scrolls thrown open at once, and fill every chamber and tunnel with light. The effect on the Algox in the chamber is immediate. All fighting and commotion immediately ceases as every Algox in sight stares dumbfounded at the spectacle, slowly comprehending the words of their god and what they mean—that some malevolent force had corrupted their thoughts and beliefs, pitting them against their own kin. But the evil has been banished, and the reasons for fighting have disappeared. Geryuu speaks through both the ice and the snow, and if their forces are combined, it will only make the Algox stronger. “The war is over,” the chief says, almost not believing the words coming out of her own mouth. “Geryuu calls for peace, and that is the end of it. Our two sects are joined together—made into one by the power of snow and ice.” Her chest expands and a soft bluish glow radiates from her open hands. “Let it be known that from this day forth there shall no longer be two sects in the north, speaking to the snow or the ice. From this day, until the end of days, we shall all be known as the Frostspeakers.” A great bellowing cheer shakes the air and for the first time in ages, Snowscorn mountain is at peace. You are given a bit of attention by a surly Algox healer, and shortly afterward, Gurndel comes to your side. “Well then,” she says, snorting in good humor at your current state. “It would seem that you, my friends, have been changed as well.” The elder gestures to one of your hands, and you notice for the first time that a small glyph has been tattooed into each of your bodies: a circle cut through with a series of thick, interlocking lines. It escaped your notice before but now it’s impossible not to marvel at the lines glimmering with bluish light. The elder smiles. “The Heart has marked you, warm-bloods. It means ‘Ally of the Frost.’ A very rare thing indeed.” It is difficult to appreciate the full gravity of the gesture—you did just fight through an army of Algox—but you give thanks as best you can.

We’ll snap it right out from under Barty Half-Ear and he’ll never see it coming, the bilge rat.” Dinah gets up from the tavern booth with a bit more spring in her step. She doesn’t get more than a few feet before she turns back to you, suddenly the picture of fury. “If you wags run off with my share I will hunt you until my dying day to wring the last drop of vigor from your corpse. I’ll see to it that the plants that draw life from your ashes a hundred years from now are bitter on the tongue, stained with the blight of your betrayal.” With that, she climbs onto the bar and shouts to the crowd: “Last call you mutts, I’ve got a good feeling my luck’s about to change.” After many grumbles from the patrons, Dinah Snapclaw is soon marching you into an icy cave tucked away just a few minutes outside the protection of Frosthaven’s walls. She walks with purpose, scampering over rocks and unfazed by the cold. The short journey gives her the chance to recount the ancient history that brought you to this point. “The Pirate Queen scored more booty than any swab before or since. Pirate royalty, really—that little Quatryl earned her title. She didn’t trust no one. A bit paranoid. Started swapping her crew out for robots, didn’t want anyone around her with a mind of their own. But the crown is a target, and some of her crew hatched a plot. They led her into a trap, thinking they could get her to give up her haul. Turns out she was a good hair crazier than they were and she sealed herself and her mechanical crew away for all eternity. If she couldn’t have it, no one could.” “The mutineers didn’t live much longer than that, particularly after other crews heard about what they’d done. Pirate lives are shorter than you landlubbers’. But they at least had the good notion to mark where they’d left the Queen’s forever- grave. They used the coins of the day, and if you can find the right ones they’re the key to a particular device…” The Vermling sets her torch into a sconce at the back of the cave. With a sweeping motion of her arm she brushes the frost off a stone carving set deep into the rock. “What, you didn’t think I posted up in Frosthaven because it’s a good spot for a tavern, did you? You’re all terrible tippers. I wanted to keep an eye on this here lock. With the coins in the right spots we’ll finally know where those mutineers buried the Pirate Queen and her treasure.” 113.1 • Tavern Upgraded",

      "text": "If you give Droman the order to prepare a psychic bomb, read You sit at your regular table in The Crater, trying to enjoy your mugs of ale as the inexhaustible tinkerer Pinter Droman chatters ceaselessly. He has been at your side constantly since the bathysphere mission, peppering you with questions… which is exactly why you decided you needed a drink. “Now, on a scale of one to ten, how many fires occurred onboard during your dive? I theorized only a small probability that the air tanks would explode, and—” Pinter’s questions are cut short as an Orchid guard runs breathlessly up to your table. “You have a, uh… a visitor... at the dock gate…” she pants. “It’s a… Lurker. And it, uh, wants to see you, I think?” You put your drinks down and head toward the docks, where you see a lone Lurker sitting patiently. You recognize Sun in Shallows, the Lurker who first told you about the shards and the fate of its people. Archers line the walls, plucking nervously at their bowstrings as you wave for the gate to open and go out to meet your caller. It’s clear that Sun in Shallows has seen combat since you last met; new cracks run like spiderwebs over her shell and the Lurker leans to one side as she sits, favoring a few injured legs. The giant crustacean perks up as you approach, her psychic singsong greeting echoing in your minds. You wonder what could compel this creature to risk the wrath of the Frosthaven guards, but you realize you already know—the shards. They, and the crown they form, compel Sun in Shallows and her awakened brethren as much as they compel you. Your suspicions are confirmed as Sun in Shallows delivers her message, a stream of images and emotions running like a tapestry through your minds: Huge coral structures reach upward like claws from the edges of a crater in the ocean floor, creating the impression of an enormous flower in mid-bloom. You feel the presence of a shard there, but the vision is obscured by an inky swirl of fear and darkness. The swirl expands as you watch, an unnatural aura attaching to the shard, guarding it, and drawing the Lurkers in the area under its influence, turning their already clouded minds to its purpose. They swarm around the shard hundreds strong: a horde, gathering to protect and spread the ever-growing corruption. You see Sun in Shallows leading a group of Lurkers on an ill-fated attack to unseat the source of the corruption and retake the shard. From the intense sorrow accompanying the vision, you don’t need to see the fight to know that Sun in Shallows was the only one to escape alive. The Lurker’s vision fades from your mind, but you see the stakes quite clearly: the crown can never be reunited until you get that shard, but more than that, this source of evil is gathering more beneath the waves, and it will continue to attack you—to attack Frosthaven—to corrupt as many shards as it can. But what can you do against such might? “A psychic blast.” A voice from behind startles you. You hadn’t realized Pinter Droman had followed you from The Crater, much less that he’d been privy to the Lurker’s bleak vision. The tinkerer continues, almost to himself. “Too many to fight, even with a hundred bathyspheres. Yes, yes, but with their psychic attunement... it’s possible we could take advantage of that...stun them, perhaps…” He starts pacing, speaking more and more quickly as he gets excited about his idea. “I’d need to study this Lurker, of course; run some tests. Maybe even get a better look at one of those shards and find a way to harness its psychic energy... It’ll take some time, but I’m sure I could come up with a device to do the trick!” Your response is cut short by a wave of sorrow washing over you. You don’t think Sun in Shallows can understand the words, but the Lurker can clearly sense the tinkerer’s intent, and her distress is palpable. The prospect of using the coral shards—her symbols of hope—to do harm to her confused brethren fills her with despair. The intensity fades quickly, though, as you feel Sun in Shallows accept that this may be the only way to reunite the crown and save her people from whatever foul thing is taking them. You feel a release, a resignation, and now a vision of the crown floats in front of you, coming to rest in your hands. Sun in Shallows leaves the decision to you. “Just to be clear,” Pinter warns, “we’ll detonate this device right on top of where the shard is located. If I do my job right, it should knock out all the Lurkers in the area, but I can’t guarantee there won’t be some collateral damage at the epicenter.” You nod in understanding. 114.2 • Attacking the Lurkers",

Instead write the solution to the next puzzle on the same page. “Splendid,” Crain says without any hint of irony. You are standing several dozen feet below ground in a nearly lightless crypt and all around lie piles of recently slain undead. “Really marvelous.” When you returned to Crain to make a report on this “death site”, the Quatryl asked so many questions that you decided it was easier to just show him. Ten minutes down here, and the Quatryl has already pocketed a hunk of stone wall, two vials of dirt, a glob of imp residue, a square of matted fur, and a handful of loose teeth. Only once his pockets are bulging with dusty remains does the scholar stop and explain. “These bodies,” he says, “confirm Logren’s theory about this place. Now, I simply need to repeat her experiment and we’ll know for certain.” Crain unties a small storm lantern from his pack and, after adding a dram of odd-smelling oil to the reservoir, lights it. The flame catches and burns an eerie green and, the instant it’s lit, several wisps of greenish vapor rise from the stonework and coalesce around the lamp. “There,” Crain says. “This is what the researchers were investigating, a divergent energy that lingered—still lingers, apparently—in certain parts of the North. I’m still working through the notes but, from what I’ve read, this energy always reacts to the burning of a particular solution and it always triggers certain,” he nods at the pile of undead bodies, “unusual phenomenon.” Crain puts his lamp down and the green vapor begins to build, swirling around it like a tiny storm. “Logren and her team theorized that the energy was the result of war fought long ago in the North. This crypt lies on one of the major battlegrounds.” The green storm circling his lamp gets bigger by the second. “In order to understand the nature of the energy, we’ll need to investigate the other sites. There should be a few more points along the northern coast. I’ll give you a set of coordinates for a place to start.” He hands you a note that simply reads 3M-1L-7A. You then watch as Crain pulls on a thick, oversized leather glove and, moving quickly, tries to snuff the lamp. However, when he reaches down, the green vapor attacks his gloved hand and tears at it with angry spectral teeth, taking out several visible chunks.

You offer to help, but she resists, jumping out of the suit and gazing in dismay at the smoking wreckage. With a ferocious scowl she rounds on you. “Look at what you’ve done! Look at –” she breaks off as a myriad of Vermling faces peer from the shadows. Vermlings who, because she’d mind-controlled them, are afraid of her. “– look at what I’ve done,” she finishes, mortified. Letting her cracked helmet clatter to the ground, she sighs. “In truth, I didn’t intend for my experiment to go this far. Somehow my passion for advocating for my people turned into this diabolical obsession. I just wanted to change what everyone thought of us.” She lapses into thought, and at her quietude, a few of the rats from her suit scurry over.

When you return to Frosthaven, you meet up with the sister and her brothers, who made it safely back. They are injured, but they will live and are very grateful for all your help. Crain Tallengyr, the Quatryl scholar you rescued from the Unfettered catacombs, has transformed his previously clean, albeit sparse, room into the cluttered, cramped nest of an academic. Somehow between last night and this morning, the Quatryl has gathered several books and a large stack of parchment and he’s arranged everything on the floor around him like a flimsy mosaic. Behind him is a plate of half-eaten eggs and hard biscuits and several empty teacups. The bed is still made but the top sheet has been confiscated to sop up a large puddle of ink on the floor. His door is open and when you knock on the frame, his face lifts into a manic smile. “Oh, yes, them,” Crain waves his hands dismissively. “Certainly a problem. I suppose we are the ones best equipped to intervene. I’ve had plenty of time to study them, you see, and I am confident that if you bring me back into their facility to scavenge for some materials, I can create a device that will deactivate the Unfettered. “But that,” Crain says pointedly, pulling out his book again, “is not the exciting part.” The Quatryl clearly wants to move on from those memories, so you take the hint and ask what he’s working on.

Bad luck to set forth on an unnamed vessel!” You smash the bottle on the hull and watch as the carpenter and their assistants launch the ship into the chilly waters.

Certainly, parts of life could have gone better; Frosthaven is not the future you imagined in your youth. But all the same, you are generally content with how things turned out. “It’s just something I’ve been reading in the journal,” He stands and clambers down the side of the building until he lands next to you.

While distracted with the Vermling, a massive storm rolled up right on top of your small ship. “Batten down the hatches!” The captain yells. “By the Oak, this is going to be a terrible storm!” You regain bits of your motor function right as you are about to slide overboard. Rattusca is nowhere to be found, but you’ve got bigger problems anyway. The storm is tossing this ship around like a plaything, and your head is ringing fiercely. The Icespeaker is Vanjal. He has HxC hit points and is immune to all conditions except those Faye applies. From now on, on initiative 11 each round, Faye focuses on Vanjal and performs 3; 3+L, . Whenever she performs this attack, on initiative 99 the following round, she instead performs 2, self, before acting on initiative 11 again the following round. Faye’s maximum hit point value is still 8+(3xL). 146.2 • Frozen Treasure (90) 146.3 • A Contained Fire (89)",

Your mind snaps back to your real body with a crackle that leaves the lingering feeling of ash at the back of your throat. Every breath you inhale reeks of overwhelming citrus, your brain still unsure which senses mean what. Gem opens the wooden box and dumps in a satchel of stale-looking ants, which combine with the existing bugs in a swirling mass and pour out onto the floor. The old Orchid looks delighted at the sight. “Zu! My sweet Zu, I could not be happier to see you! Here, I have a cloak for you.” The mass of Harrower responds in halted, startled words: “What? No! How could thissss bee? Gemmm… it was a life sentence.” “Sure, and it lasted all the guards’ lives and then some,” Gem retorts. “But you and I, we live longer than this lot. Do you want the cloak or not?” “We have yet to pay my penanccce.” Zu drags out the last word, a hint of sorrow in their voice. Gem puts her hands on her hips. “Enough moping.

Return to 182.2 to reference its special rules, if necessary. With some hesitation, you pick up the mirror. It must have some power still within it, so there’s no point leaving it behind. When you look into it, however, your whole world shifts. You see your reflection staring back at you, but you are also the reflection, staring from the other side back at someone who is and isn’t you. You are... yep, you are in two places at once. Your mind is simultaneously processing being on both sides of the mirror wall, and it is giving you a massive headache. No wonder that Savvas was grumpy. At least with it dead, the Shimmer’s power over this place is gone, and a new way forward emerges. The machine is destroyed. After the roiling smoke dissipates, you search for evidence of where the Mindthief has gone, but she has only left behind the sad remains of her experiment: the shattered contraptions, numerous befuddled or deceased guards, and a handful of Vermlings caught up in her ambition. This isn’t over. The Mindthief might return to execute the remainder of her plan. Feeling like you’ve failed Captain Olmstead, you return to Frosthaven to give him your report. With one eye on his subdued guards, who are carrying back the bodies of their fellows, he gravely listens to your tale of the Mindthief and her escape. “She needs to be brought to justice,” he grunts. “I have an old friend. Someone who may help find her.” The old friend is a Valrath named Kefra. Once a renowned cartographer, she now uses her impeccable eye for detail to hire herself out as a tracker. “Got ourselves a rogue Vermling, eh?” She cracks her fingers in anticipation. “Vermlings are like any other beast, leaving wreckage in their wake. Wreckage which can be traced. I’ll find her.” You’re not sure this Vermling is that simple. But there’s nothing to do now except wait. Both doors 2 are now unlocked. Remove the other goal treasure tile. For the rest of the scenario, the character who looted the goal treasure tile gains disadvantage on all their attacks and exists on both sides of the map.

All of its many separate robotic parts are shifting and crawling around each other, attempting to form a cohesive whole, but apparently failing. Its head, which houses the array that aggregates the processing power of the other units, is blabbering semi-incoherently. After spending some time with it, as best as you can gather, its unique structure of decentralized processing has caused a glitch wherein the processing of the various disparate parts has become too decentralized. The parts no longer want to work in unison, and the head is doing its best to keep them together, but it is a losing battle. Eventually, it accepts that it just has to give up, and tumbles down into a chaotic heap. And then they start walking, crawling, and hopping away in every direction, causing all the townsfolk who had gathered to watch the ruckus to run away in terror. You try to herd them back together, but there are just too many of them, and they have no interest in returning to their previous form.

Oh, and an opportunity for the outpost, of course!” A Quatryl wrapped in a thick green cloak paces the floor of Satha’s cabin, lost in thought as the mayor looks on from her seat by a map-strewn table. Satha raises a hand in greeting as you open the door, and the Quatryl whirls toward you, startled. “OH! Yes, perfect, perfect, you must be the ones Satha mentioned. Pinter Droman, tinkerer extraordinaire, at your service.” He bows with a flourish. Satha clears her throat, cutting Pinter’s introduction short. “A recent landslide changed the landscape of the Frozen Pass,” the mayor explains, “Between the rocks that fell out of the way and the valleys they filled up, we think we can create a shortcut through the Coppernecks that could save days for supply teams and merchants coming across the mountains.” You recall your own recent journey over the pass, and agree you’d have appreciated a shortcut. “That’s the spirit!” Satha continues, “A shortcut means more merchants bringing goods, and more goods means more outposters survive the winter. Pinter here is in charge of the engineering.” “Yes!” Pinter jumps back in, unable to contain his excitement. “The place we’re looking to build,” he points to a map on the table, “is a landslide area that’s almost clear of rocks. I’ve created explosive devices to help remove the rest, but the fauna of the area are quite aggressive, and I can’t get a team close enough to plant the charges.” “That’s where you come in,” Satha explains. “I told Pinter you’re the only ones I trust to get those bombs where they need to be and handle yourself against the local animals. We’ll have the charges packed and ready to go at dawn.” You nod and turn to go prepare your own supplies, but Pinter interjects. “And not to worry, the charges are completely safe!” he says, unprompted. “I’ve learned so much since my, er, unfortunate incident in Gloomhaven.” Somehow his assurance does not increase your confidence. 156.1 • Opening the Pass",

There’s no shortage of rumors about her, though. “Y’know, she used to sail with Barty Half-Ear, the notorious pirate.” Xain, the local barfly, is speaking in hushed tones.

Bring them to me.” Before you can get a good look at it she shoves the necklace back down her shirt. Xain steps in to explain: “Find them all and it’s supposed to lead to a massive treasure.” Dinah looks irritated. “Just bring them to me, that’s all you need to know. Now buy a drink or quit taking up the seats.” She walks off to another table in the near- empty establishment without waiting for your order. Xain turns to you, excitedly. “Wow, she must really like you guys!” He sees your faces, pushing ahead with reassurance. “She’ll open up. Just keep an eye out for the coins on your adventures.

Of course, there have been times when your temper’s gotten the better of you, when you’ve indulged more than was wise, but you’ve never been forced to spend night after night, month after month sleeping on a stone floor with nothing to look forward to but a glimmer of morning light through iron bars. So you can’t really fathom what it’s like to finally be free from prison or what a person would do when they finally got out, but you doubt they would do this. Crain Tallengyr, the Quatryl scholar you rescued from the Unfettered catacombs, has transformed his previously clean, albeit sparse, room into the cluttered, cramped nest of an academic. Somehow between last night and this morning, the Quatryl has gathered several books and a large stack of parchment and he’s arranged everything on the floor around him like a flimsy mosaic. Behind him is a plate of half-eaten eggs and hard biscuits and several empty teacups. The bed looks unused, except the top sheet has been confiscated to sop up a large puddle of ink on the floor. His door is open and when you knock on the frame, his face lifts into a manic smile. “My stalwart friends!” He bows without getting up. “Come to check on your rescued ward? What chivalry! And perfect timing, I might add. As you can tell, I’ve managed to get in a full night’s work.” Crain pulls out a hefty book with an excited look. You ask if that will help you get to the center of the Unfettered facility, and the Quatryl frowns. “Oh, fine, I suppose we could talk about that first.” Crain unfolds a set of building schematics in front of you and shows you two paths from the library that will take you to the core of the facility. One is through the duct system, bypassing the bulk of the Unfettered workers by sneaking above them 36 . The other is a long, narrow path deep in the facility that Crain says is an unfinished transportation system the Unfettered have abandoned 37 . Both lead to the central chamber, but there’s no knowing which one will yield the easier path. “Now,” Crain says pointedly, pulling out his book again, “If we could get back to this...” The Quatryl clearly wants to move on from his memories of the Unfettered facility, so you take the hint and ask what he’s so excited about.

Either way, I think it’s time to remind this plane about consequences.” Frosthaven isn’t willing to go without a fight, though: X all where X is 40 if there are less than fifteen buildings built, or otherwise 70. Target buildings randomly by drawing from the building deck. You finally manage to drive the prince back. He laughs as he steps back through a portal to his home—“An enjoyable fight, but I have other matters to attend to. See you soon.” “Now, I raise my glass to you. A toast in your honor, and to the Royal Court of Ventillion’s Empire. May you live well and never cease dancing!” With that, all animation has gone out of the chamber. The lamps flicker, and you feel a biting cold wind swirling down from the outside. This place, once magnificent, has moved on, and so must you. Whatever strange sorcery this “Emperor” engaged himself in, you’re just glad this ended in your favor.

      "text": "197.1 • Howling in the Snow (0) Drifter: You are all about playing cards that stick around for a certain number of uses before becoming lost, and then squeezing extra uses out of them. Try playing Crushing Weight early to get an extra +2 on your melee attacks, then jump into the fray and alternate between your more traditional melee attacks and melee attacks like Sustained Momentum or Bloodletting that will let you move the token on Crushing Weight back one slot. That means you get to keep that +2 bonus for even more attacks. If you start to get too close to the final space, play cards like Relentless or Unbreakable to buy yourself even more uses. You can create different builds for the Drifter based on which persistent cards you choose to play. After getting the hang of Crushing Weight, explore your other persistent abilities. You can even try using multiple ones at the same time. Boneshaper: You are a ranged support class that makes extensive use of summons. You’ll eventually have many summons, and the more of them you play, the stronger cards like Flow of the Black River and Command the Wretched become. Planning ahead to make sure your summons are positioned in the right places is key. One of your core summons is the Shambling Skeleton. Unlike a lot of summons, Shambling Skeletons go to your discard pile when they die, not your lost pile. Once one is in your discard pile, you can recover it during a short or long rest, or you can use actions like the top of Malicious Conversion to re-summon the skeleton card straight from your discard pile. But be careful—you take damage each time you summon a Shambling Skeleton. Deathwalker: You use special types of tokens called Shadows. After you place Shadows, your ability cards will let you move them around the map, attack enemies adjacent to them (even if you’re far away), or even teleport between them. Once you have a lot of Shadow tokens on the map, you are a powerful and flexible class. But be careful—it takes some time to build up, and you may not be as strong early on. The top of Call to the Abyss is a good long-term card for getting Shadows out throughout a scenario, but if you don’t expect to move very far, try combining the bottom of Call to the Abyss with the top of Eclipse on your first turn. An instant four shadows to work with will help you make short work of the first room. Then you can move some of those Shadows to the next room with cards like Dark Fog or Black Barrage. Some of your cards will let you remove Shadows for powerful effects— just be sure not to remove too many. Banner Spear: You are a melee class that can make big attacks, assuming you have an ally in the correct position. Teamwork, good communication, and a clear strategy are all very important when playing your cards. You may often find yourself choosing later initiatives so you can more easily position yourself around your allies, or pairing your attacks with actions like the bottom of Regroup to let your allies get into position. Then you can unleash actions like the top of Unbreakable Wall. Your allies aren’t the only help you get, though. You also have a number of summons you can use to pull off your attacks. Pay special attention to the bottom of At All Costs. It is a summon whose movement you can always control. It takes its turn just before you, so put it in the perfect position to set yourself up for big attacks. And if it dies, you can just bring it back after you rest. Blinkblade: You are a melee attacker with the unique decision of going fast or slow at the start of each round. Each of your cards have fast and slow initiative values, as well as a host of modifiers to your abilities, depending on whether you are going fast or slow. Understanding what each action does when going fast or slow, and knowing when to go fast and when to go slow, is the key to success. Try setting up combos: go slow one round to be last in initiative order, then go fast in the next round to be first. One example is pairing the top of Sap Speed and the bottom of Temporal Displacement while slow, then follow up with another big round of attacks by using the top of Power Leak and the bottom of Twin Strike. Geminate: You have two different forms, and some of your cards will force you to switch between them. Your first form focuses primarily on multi-target melee attacks use area of effect patterns. Your other form focuses on more traditional ranged attacks, except your enemies have to be at least a certain distance away. Try setting up combos across the different forms. Pair Into my Embrace with a slower initiative card to go late, pull an enemy close, switch forms, and then go early next round to hit them with Icebound Quills. While you have a lot of powerful lost actions, it is important to make your two hands stay similarly sized. If you switch forms, and that form doesn’t have enough cards to play, you will be forced to waste that turn long resting and switching back. 2023 CEPHALOFAIR GAMES, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Your hands, the stones beneath you, even the air is cloaked in sheets of tangible shadow. A short distance away is a creature: a lanky figure of bone and sickly skin, of twisted vertebrae and horn. It faces you with naked pride. This is a true monster of the dark divine—something dredged from the very bottom of the Void. It is corruption incarnate, a body molded and possessed by vileness itself. “So clever,” the demon says. Its voice is a grating whine that tears at your ears and makes your muscles clench. “So clever to find my home and my beauties. But what now?

You bring it closer, admiring its crags and hollows, but as you do, you feel its weight grow. It presses down on your hand and then into your mind, sinking into you and pulling. The coral shard speaks to each of you, not with words, but with desires. It wants to move north, far out to sea, away from the cliffs and the frozen safety of Frosthaven. And it wants you to take it there. This must have been what the Lurkers were after: a strange goal for what you thought were beasts no more sophisticated than wolves or spiders. Yet as the chunk of coral speaks to you, you know it to be true. They sought this object, and in order to understand why, you’ll have to follow the pull of the shard north across the water.

      "text": "The shard breaks loose with a final heave, skittering onto the stones. All at once, the battle around you stops. The creatures turn and stare, their eyes wide, and then flee, shrieking into the water. The new shard is much like the first piece you found, small and hollow, but still you are taken by its beauty. In fact, you are so transfixed that you hardly notice that several new shapes have risen from the water around you. That is, until a lilting echo rings out, like a musician playing a crystal glass. You turn and find a semi-circle of Lurkers watching you from the shallows. You prepare for another fight, but the monsters make no move to attack. Instead, the Lurker in the center tilts her head, repeating the same eerie tone. You realize then that she didn’t actually make a sound, but somehow caused you to “hear” its greeting inside your heads. The echo fades, and with it you feel your aggression wash away—you won’t need your weapons. The Lurker steps forward from the others, and a shared vision flashes through your minds: sunlight filtering through coastal shallows, dancing in dappled waves over a delicate coral reef. The vision fades almost instantly, but you realize with surprise that the Lurker is introducing herself: This image—Sun in Shallows—is the creature’s name. The Lurker turns her attention to the coral shards. She wants them too, you can tell; whatever pull you feel from the shards tugs at these Lurkers twice as hard. You sense sadness, confusion, jealousy that the shards have chosen land-dwellers. But Sun in Shallows doesn’t move to take the treasures; instead, she inhales deeply, her chinked carapace swelling. When she exhales, you feel another vision invite itself into your mind—a story told in a series of psychic images. Deep, deep beneath the waves, a beautiful crown rests on a pedestal in a palace made of woven amethyst coral—the work of thousands of architects over hundreds of years. A throng of Lurkers has assembled to witness a coronation. The crown calls to you from within the vision, consuming your focus as the rest of the image fades away. You draw closer to it, feeling its power, but as you reach out to touch it, a cloud of inky sludge emerges and swirls around the crown, shattering it and plunging the assembled Lurkers into darkness. The crown is gone. What follows is a period of blind frenzy. You don’t know how many years pass in the vision, but you watch as the great underwater empire collapses, its citizens’ minds reduced to animal instinct. Artistry, craft, even language—all are forgotten in the Lurkers’ decline. Then, in the darkness, hope: a pinprick, an oasis of light in the endless black sea. Then another, then another, calling out to each other. They are pieces of the ruined crown, scattered across the world. You see a few Lurkers in these oases begin to stir from their haze and seek the shards out, though the other Lurkers remain in the clutches of the inky water. Finally, a plea: you see the shards pull back together in your vision, re-making the coral crown and banishing the darkness from the realm of the Lurkers forevermore. The vision fades, and you’re left blinking in the sunlight. Sun in Shallows stands before you, her hope for the future of the ancient Lurker kingdom laid bare. All that remains of your vision is the all-consuming pull of the crown, which lingers in your minds as if asking a question: Will you do it? The creatures stand patiently in the surf, their huge, barrel-sized claws hanging taught before them. You feel the sting of the crown, the emptiness in your chest. You nod, and Sun in Shallows breaks into celebratory chitters. She and most Lurkers descend back into the waters, but one remains, an offer of aid clear in your minds. And then the shards redouble their pull, drawing you now to the east, farther out into the sea. Choose one: Unlock class box OR unlock class box.

Frosthaven is almost exactly what you imagined: a knot of gray stone and timber surrounded by sharpened palisade walls—a place where mere survival is an everyday concern and where only the desperate could feel at home. Thankfully though, the townsfolk are tough. They’re already on their feet, dousing fires and picking through rubble. In fact, one of those townspeople is marching right for you; a sharp-featured human woman with a fighter’s muscular build, close-cropped hair and dark skin, approaches and offers a gauntleted hand in greeting.“The sea be praised,” she says, crushing your fingers with enthusiasm. “We wouldn’t have held out much longer without you.” You nod and ask what happened. “Oh, just life up north is all,” she chuckles. “I’m Satha, mayor of this fort now that my predecessor and his lieutenant have fallen. As for the Algox, they’ve been at us all winter. Took them months to break through, but they finally did. Killed a dozen or so of my people... and would’ve done worse if you hadn’t shown up.” You explain who you are, that you’ve been sent from White Oak. At the mention of the capital, her face scrunches up in displeasure. “It’s about time they sent someone to help fix this mess they made,” she says, then tries to lighten her mood. “I don’t mean to be ungrateful. I am overjoyed to still be among the living, but a lot more people would be alive if your employers, the Merchant’s Guild, never stuck their noses in our business. “I’ve spent my whole life here in what was once a fishing village, living and letting live with the Algox. Until last summer, that is, when the Merchant’s Guild sent some garrisons and bureaucratic-types up here to see how Frosthaven could ‘be of more use to the empire’. One of their expeditions proceeded to muck about in an Algox burial site, and the next thing we know, righteously angry Algox are attacking us. The ink-stains immediately high-tailed it out of here, leaving just a handful of soldiers behind to keep us safe.” Satha clenches her gauntlet tighter and tighter as she tells the story, but now releases her grip. “I’ve had to learn a lot of things in the last year. The hard truth is that the Algox refuse to be reasoned with, and the only way to stay alive and keep this place I call home is to win the fight, regardless of who started it.” Her face softens and she clasps your shoulder, hard. “There’s not many of you, but I’ll take what I can get, especially now that our garrison’s been thinned. And as it happens, I have an idea.” She turns and gestures to the town’s smoldering walls. “We took a beating in that fight, so if we’re going to survive much longer, we’ll have to do more than just sit around and wait for the next attack.” She sizes you up carefully. “I’ve already sent a scout to track the Algox back home to the mountains. Drop your gear at any longhouse that’s still standing and rest up. As soon as you’re ready, I want you to get over there and find a way to slow these attacks.” The bunks in the remaining longhouses are all occupied by the injured, but you find a dry stretch of floor to lay your heads on your packs. You doubt you can sleep after the horror that greeted you in this little outpost, but before you know it a young Valrath man is nudging you awake: Satha’s scout has returned with his report. He tracked the attackers to the foothills of the Copperneck mountains, where they entered a cave at the base of Snowscorn Mountain 3 . Interestingly, a smaller band split from the main group before they reached the cave and hiked around to the mountain’s deadly eastern face 2 . The scout didn’t see where they went, but he suspects a secret entrance to the Algox stronghold. “One last thing,” the Valrath says as you wipe the final dregs of sleep from your eyes. “Another group is moving toward Snowscorn. They were Algox, no doubt, but they’re dressed differently than the ones who attacked us. They carried long sticks and had some wild animals with them. I don’t know if they’re going to attack the mountain or reinforce it, but either way, you’d better get there quick.” Set your morale to 2+X, where X is the number of City Guards still on the map.

      "text": "Your vessels are battered beyond reason; onboard lights flicker nervously and your viewing ports are cracked. But you’re alive, and you have the final shard. You waste no time. Back at the altar, you carefully arrange the shards as you had just a few moments ago. Your breathing is shallow; the air is wearing thin. You know you should head back to the surface, but you can’t leave now—the shards won’t allow it. They compel you to finish what you started. The pieces move together in the dimness, one snapping into the next until finally there are only two halves. And there, at the bottom of the ocean, your hearts thumping, you bring the final pieces together. Light. A painful bloom of white and gold. The shards, which a moment ago were little more than chunks of coral, are transformed into a curve of golden brilliance—the crown. It’s just how you remember it from your visions: a radiant circlet of light and power, an exultant beacon for a new age. It radiates with light and fills the dome with a marigold brilliance. It doesn’t take long for the Lurkers to respond. They arrive in droves, first hesitating at the dome’s entrance, shying from the source of this incredible shine but then their courage returns, and they fill the chamber in earnest. Thousands arrive, called to the rebirth of their empire. A great procession fills the dome, plugging every exit with chitinous limbs and excited chitters. A tall Lurker appears at the far entrance of the dome, shuffling forward as the gathered crowd parts to make way. To your surprise, you recognize Sun in Shallows, the Lurker with whom you began this quest. But this creature has been ravaged since then; war, it seems, has taken a great toll. Two of the Lurker’s legs are missing, and one of her eyes is sealed permanently shut. Scars and gouges mark its shell, wounds from countless battles, and yet Sun in Shallows trudges forward all the same, using her claws to keep balance. When she reaches you, she stands on the opposite side of the pedestal and repeats the mental echo greeting she first hailed you with so long ago. The crowd echoes back, an eerie keening symphony that swells with anticipation as Sun in Shallows lifts the crown. At once, she is transformed. The light that radiated throughout the dome cascades downward and infuses itself into the wearer of the crown. The Lurker is imbued, rising with new strength. The light pours onto the wearer and etches elaborate designs into its shell: intricate golden filigree interlocking to form a great tapestry of a regal tattoo, each line shining like the morning sun. The coronation complete, the Lurker queen turns to you. Her vision comes to you clearly, powerful with intent: A new age of enlightenment has begun for the Lurkers, and with it unity and peace between the people of the sea and the coastal settlements of land-dwellers. Gratitude suffuses the vision, warm and joyful. You have returned to the Lurkers their greatest treasure, and with it their hope. The vision fades, and Sun in Shallows presents her claws and bows deeply in a display of respect. The water around you dances as the gathered crowd snap their claws in celebration. The feeling of gratitude remains with you as you journey back to the surface and rejoin your crew, leaving the Lurkers beneath the waves to rebuild their empire. The ship’s mate charts a course back home, and you regale the crew with the tale of your journey beneath the waves. It’s a harrowing story, and yet as you tell and retell it in the weeks that follow, you always leave one part unsaid. It’s a feeling that’s followed you ever since you resurfaced, and it only intensifies as you approach Frosthaven and put more and more distance between yourselves and the Lurker city. You weren’t sure what it was at first, but now, after several long nights of rumination, of staring out at the moonlit waves, you are certain. It’s a haunting desire, a hunger to own something you can never have—it is the deep, unrelenting pull of the crown. Gain 2 morale and 1 prosperity. Gain 30 each.

In front of you is Crain’s newest creation: a series of glass lenses, each coated in a different varnish and arranged around a small metal platter. On that platter, sits a vial of multi- colored liquid. Crain draws the shade on his shed’s singular window and then aims a small mining lamp at one of the lenses. As soon as he does, the contraption floods with light and then projects a strange prism onto the ceiling. “It took some serious alchemy, but I’ve distilled the energy signature from the spire,” Crain says. “And it’s the strangest thing I’ve ever seen.” The light dances across the ceiling, composed of fifteen or twenty multi-colored ribbons that weave in and out of each other, seemingly at random. “Now this is the energy signature from the Radiant Forest.” Crain switches out the vial for a different one full of red liquid, and the prism changes completely. Instead of twenty ribbons moving at random, there are now only seven or eight, all shaded red, and all bound together like a rope that’s swaying in the wind. “The signature from—” Crain is interrupted by warning horns from the wall: Algox to the east. Crain’s demeanor immediately switched to one of complete rage. He grabs an empty vial and flings it against a wall. “I can’t take it!” He yells, his outburst punctuated by shattering glass. “The horns! The attacks! The... clanging of metal!” He punctuates this last bit with another vial. “I can’t do my work like this!” He laments. “There’s too much stress—too much commotion. Can you do anything to stop the incessant Algox raids? Go out there and make some friends or something.

You motion to the field, to the spikes of ice and the dead Algox that lie behind you, and ask what it was all for. A look of desperation falls over the wounded Algox. “If you had asked weeks ago, I would have said it was for justice... But now, it looks like a reason to get ourselves killed.” You offer to take him back to Snowscorn and the Snowspeakers, where he may get healing in exchange for information about this whole plot. The survivor shrugs, but you sense a willingness in him. “Fine then, warm-bloods. Take me back. I want to look the snow-sniffers in the eye.” After a day of travel you arrive at the mountain and find the Snowspeaker chief in the central chamber. “You bring curious reports,” the chief says, turning toward the captured Icespeaker, “And you, ice-lover,” she leers at the captured Icespeaker. “What can you say of yourself? What are these ‘conduits’?” The battered Algox speaks plainly. “They are weapons,” he snorts, and a ripple of angry shock shoots through the assembled crowd. “A forest of crystals that, when called upon by the Icespeakers, would unleash a force that no army could withstand.” His words still carry venom, but they are thinned by exhaustion. “However, Geryuu has turned against us, sending burrowers to slaughter us all.

There will never be a time when bloodshed is not met by more bloodshed, and I say now is the time for change.” “You are as naïve as your ancestors then.” A tall young Snowspeaker steps forward and addresses the crowd, her voice thick with arrogance. “Sit down, Denpang!” The chief instructs, but the young Snowspeaker does not move. “Shall we simply stand by and let these heretics activate their weapons, destroying our families in the Whitefire A clamor of “No,” rises up. “No, of course not,” the newcomer, Denpang, smirks at the chieftain. “And with these champions on our side, we will have victory once and for all. We must plan for an assault, and these warm- bloods had best come with us if they wish to remain in our favor.” With a final confident snort, the young Algox departs, taking with her a sizable portion of the gathered Snowspeakers. The chief nods as if she expected such an outcome. “Do not listen to her,” she says. “It is peace we must seek. I have a plan to heal the divide between our two groups, but it will take time to arrange a peace summit with the Icespeakers. And I will also do what I can to delay Denpang’s assault.

Thankfully, a long stay in one of the tavern’s new rooms seems to have done the scholar some good. You find him sitting in the common room, nursing a cup of broth in front of the fire. “Why, if it isn’t my old friends, come to pay me a visit.” His voice is subdued, almost calm. He’s wearing a thick cotton cloak and looking at you with a placid, doe-eyed smile. You carry on some tepid small talk before Crain offers to show you his room. “It’s quite cozy, really,” he says, shuffling down the hall like an elderly man. “Satha really knows what’s best sometimes.

I quite expected my rescue party sooner, but this should do well.” With a bit of effort, you pry the Quatryl loose and, as soon as he’s free, watch him stretch with genuine pleasure. “Ah then, now we can have a proper introduction.” He extends a long, delicate hand. “Crain Tallengyr, at your service.” You introduce yourselves, explaining that while you aren’t a rescue party per se, you’re happy to lend a hand, and you ask how he came to be caged so far below ground. You learn through an exceedingly self-important lecture that Crain is an academic who ventured down here one year ago on an ill-advised solitary exploration. He was eventually captured by the machines and has been kept prisoner ever since. You ask whether he knows another way out of this complex other than that infernal elevator. “I should say I do,” says the Quatryl, nodding emphatically. “I’ve been here a year and am well versed in this place, and the Unfettered have a dozen dozen little ways to ingress and egress as they please.” You stop him for a moment and question this term, “the Unfettered.” “Oh yes, right, well, that’s what they’ve named themselves, you see? The machines, that is. Unfettered. They were built long ago by an elder civilization. You see—” Crain dives back into his prison cell and pries up a piece of bent metal to reveal a hidden stash. When he reemerges he’s holding a sheaf of folded papers that look to be cut from a larger text. “They left a history! Whoever they were, they were kind enough to record some of their thoughts and, although their script is quite archaic, I think I’ve got the general idea through some of the illustrations. Now, originally it would appear that these ancient engineers created the machines as a source of cheap labor, but in the years since it would seem that the machines have found a way to keep themselves in operation without anyone around to command them, hence their name.” Crain pauses for you to look impressed with his theory. A piece of dead machine clatters to the ground. “Anyway, more troubling than that is that these machines appear to be planning something, perhaps an assault if you want my opinion, and judging by their numbers, I don’t know that any force above ground is prepared to take them on.” At this ominous utterance, the Quatryl groans and holds his head. “Oh my, I think I’ve spent too much time in that cage...” Crain stumbles and collapses to the ground. If you want any more information out of him, it’s probably best to bring him back to Frosthaven and give him some time to recover. Add 128.2 to the calendar in four weeks.

      "text": "Add 169.3 to the calendar in four weeks. While destroying machines doesn’t quite provide the same satisfaction as, say, slaying monsters, there is a certain pleasure in returning the room to silence; libraries should be quiet, after all. Looking around, you find that the room has held up better than you’d first thought. The shelves are packed with books, and many of them are still quite legible, though their pages are brittle to the touch. You while away some time browsing, and discover two particularly illuminating texts. The first is an unusually shaped book, much taller and wider than the others. Taking it down, you find within it a complex series of diagrams—maps, you realize—that lay out a portion of this complex. You find the library, demarcated by a scribble of ink and, from the library, you can see two avenues branching outward: paths leading to what must be the central core of this place. The map shows an immense inkwork of intricate, almost knotlike design: thousands upon thousands of lines and shapes all leading toward some great labyrinthian chamber. You turn the page yet again and inside that chamber you find another, smaller room made in a triangular design. The script below the map is confusing, but it looks similar to the common word for ‘thought.’ The second book is even more helpful, though at first you take it for junk: the cover is dry, cracked leather, and half the pages have been cut out. The pages that remain offer only a dense, tight script written in a language far older than any spoken today. You are about to toss the book aside when a voice makes you freeze. “I say, you’ve found one of my favorites there.” You turn and find a Quatryl, short, dressed in rags, shuffling through the far door with a heavy ball and chain shackled to his ankle. “Of course, I’ve borrowed the best section on something of a long-term loan,” the Quatryl laughs and fishes from his shirt a sheaf of folded paper. “I’ll let you read it if you get me out of this thing.” You go to the Quatryl’s side and, with a bit of effort, help him out of his restraints. You learn that he is an academic named Crain Tallengyr who ventured down here one year ago on an ill-advised solitary exploration. He was eventually captured by the machines and has been kept prisoner ever since. “They’re quite rude really, but they are an impressive force. Being their unwilling companion all this time, I have learned quite a bit about the Unfettered.” You interrupt to ask about the name, ‘Unfettered.’ “Fascinating isn’t it? That’s what they’ve named themselves, these machines. A bit melodramatic if you ask me, but I suppose it fits. Their origins are actually hidden in that tome you were about to toss.” Crain unfolds his sheaf of papers and shows you more of the cramped, eye-glazing text. “The language is archaic, but I’ve been able to glean the general idea from the illustrations. I believe that these machines were once used as a source of cheap labor. To what end, I am less certain, but, as their name suggests, the Unfettered work for themselves now. More troubling, however, is that they appear to be planning something, perhaps an assault if you want my opinion, and judging by their numbers, I don’t know that any force aboveground is prepared to take them on. I believe therefore, that we, or rather you, may be the only party able to intervene in time. I can direct you toward their central chamber.” There is no need for deliberation. Having fought what machines you have, you’re confident in Crain’s analysis: if you can stop the Unfettered from attacking the land above then you have to try. The only question then is how to proceed. Unfortunately, all this excitement has clearly caused the Quatryl some stress. He groans and holds his head. “Oh my, I think I need to lie down for a bit...” Crain stumbles and collapses to the ground. If you want any more information out of him, it’s probably best to bring him back to Frosthaven and give him some time to recover. Gain 10 each.

The Snowspeakers apparently managed to set up a small camp on the outskirts of the Crystal Fields, but they’re so battered from the war and the ensuing retreat that they can hardly tend to their wounded, much less rebuild. Satha continues, “The problem is, I can’t justify sending out supplies to a clan of Algox. These people never spared a thought to help us.” It’s an understandable position, but the Snowspeakers’ plight feels personal. Ever since the battle of the spire, you’ve felt a weight hanging over you. This presents an opportunity to lighten it. You make a deal with Satha: if she can offer half the requested supplies, then you will carry them to the tribe and help the Snowspeakers yourself. The suggestion makes her grin. “You southerners are too soft,” she says, but her smile widens, and she agrees to the terms.

A Lurker got half his ear, but I was supposed to have half his treasure. ’Til he betrayed me, tossing me to the piranha pigs like I was the scullery boy.” She pauses to spit on the floor, and you don’t interrupt to ask why the scullery boy deserved such a fate. “But I lived, and I want what’s mine.” A patron who is new in town taps Dinah on the shoulder, inquiring about a drink. Dinah spins around and sneers with a deep growl, leaving the patron apologizing and backpedaling. No wonder The Crater has been busier than ever. She turns her attention back to you. “He told me time and again that he knew of the biggest haul—the one earned by the Pirate Queen. Knew more about it than most, even told me the secret to find it. Four ancient coins: he had one, I found another. That haul was part mine by rights.” She pops her neck with a loud crack, then continues. “He had an old hideout. I’d bet this crummy bar he’s storing that coin of his there. Go and get it.” She flashes the coin hanging around her neck. “Come to me with all three coins and I’ll share what I’ve got. Then we’ll get rich together.” With that, she rises, tossing her stool across the tavern with a clatter. She shouts to the room: “Drinks tonight are free and tongue lashings are on tap!

There’s meaning here—these aren’t just individual tomes, they’re a complete hidden history!” You leave Eddica to her research and return a few hours later. She’s thankfully calmer, but a broad smile makes clear she’s ready to share the results. “Belara, a Savvas channeler, did write the Tomes of Power. But the power turned the Savvas to evil, and it threatened to use the tomes against all of creation. The Orchid High Council had to step in, which is exceptionally unusual for them. It wasn’t easy, but the Tomes were wrested away and scattered to make sure Belara would never wield them. The fight should have killed the poor Savvas, but instead its mind was cracked in half by the High Council and it was sealed away to live out its days.” Eddica takes a deep breath, but looks too embarrassed to make eye contact. “I… I know where Belara is.

Spoke a good deal about capricious spirits and the like, beings that appear during northern storms and vanish into the air. Logren found the poem and thought the creature might be related to the energy.” Crain tosses two handfuls of kindling onto the already roaring fire. You squint at the flames and spot a small object that he seems to be heating: a brass orb, except it can’t be brass because it hasn’t melted or changed shape. “Her team found the Ice Prince, same as you, but their visit didn’t go as well. She ultimately ruled it out as an avenue for investigation, too dangerous and no obvious connection to the energy. I’d been hoping she made a mistake but no, she doesn’t seem to make any.” Crain takes up a pair of billows and works the flames until they’re practically scorching his face. “In any case,” he says, head turned from the heat. “They did speak of an energy site not too far from where you were. A forest.” Crain takes a pair of tongs and removes his heated orb. It’s glowing now, a dark red ball that he immediately plunges into a bucket of water, filling the room with steam. “That look on your face reminds me of Satha. ‘Crain stop smelting metal in your quarters, Crain stop testing elixirs on the watchmen, Crain stop trying to capture lightning in a cage.’ A bunch of worriers, the lot of you.” Crain reaches his tongs into the bucket and pulls out the cooled orb. It’s taken on a deep black color and there are faint scratches going all around its exterior that look similar to the ancient quatryl writing. “Just go explore that forest already. Torfi’s notes say something about an energy source, and then “up, down, right”. If you can figure out what that means, then maybe I will be able to figure out this blasted experiment!” Crain says this with finality and dumps the orb unceremoniously back in the fire.

Given you’ve never seen him outside his room, you find it a bit odd and set out to find him. Nearly half an hour later, you spot the Quatryl shuffling between cabins. In one hand, he’s carrying a half-used torch and in the other, a pot of pine pitch. As you approach, you notice he’s shaking his head and talking, as if stuck in an argument with himself. It isn’t until you’re a few feet away that he notices you. “Ah ha,” he says, a bit surprised. “It’s nice to see you again. And what’s that?” You hand him your notes on the diagram and explain what happened in the spire, but the Quatryl seems distracted. “Yes, it’s troubling. Good work, but troubling.” He pockets the note. “Listen, I have some news as well, but I’m in the middle of an experiment so you’ll have to walk with me while I explain.” The Quatryl starts moving without waiting for a response. “The book, Project Source,” he rattles on, gesturing with his charred stick. “I’ve made some more progress with the translation, but in order to move any further I need you to verify some of the—er—findings.” The two of you snake between cabins and Crain pauses to sift through a pile of junk, pulling from it a piece of ruined cloth which he wraps around the used torch. Satisfied, he keeps moving. “According to their notes, the researchers concluded the energy source at the spire was too dangerous to work with and so it was ultimately abandoned—a very grim account, I assure you. Though it sounds like you know exactly what they mean.” He stops at a section of the palisade wall and, using a metal spoon, scrapes out a bit of clay from between the logs. He crumbles the clay into his pitch pot and keeps walking. “But their account did help me crack one of their thornier words in their dialect—death. “It would seem these researchers were very interested in the concept. After the incident at the spire complex, they went on to investigate a new location, one they only refer to as the ‘death site.’ I need you to find it and tell me what’s inside. Torfi’s journal contains a sketch of some device at the site. If you come across it in your travels—should be in a temple or crypt of some kind—hopefully her notes will prove useful.” Crain comes to a sudden halt. He’s brought you to one of the guard stations, right next to one of the iron braziers they use to keep warm. The guards themselves watch from their post as Crain, without any ceremony or explanation, Crain dunks his stick into the pitch pot and then shoves the gloopy thing into the guard’s fire, which bursts into a violent blue flame. “Ach, all wrong.” Crain holds up his torch, the flame burning a brilliant sky blue. He scoffs, drops it into the snow, and walks off. Turn to the next page in the puzzle book. 43.5 • Puzzle Solution 2023 CEPHALOFAIR GAMES, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. USED WITH PERMISSION.",

Much of his gear and books survived the fire, thankfully, but with no place to go just yet, Crain begins the experiment right there on the snowy road. He lights the green lantern and sets it down next to the radiant stone and it immediately draws a reaction.

Crain, muttering something about not wanting to hear Mayor Satha lecture again, turns out the lamp before the vapor builds any more. “That’s three energy sources, now,” he says, with new vigor. “That means I can finally move on from fiddling with these little fireplace experiments and get on to the real work.” He laughs and a sinking feeling grows in your stomach. “Which reminds me, before the incident, I’d been translating a new section of the book and I wanted to run it by you.” Crain hands you a strip of parchment that’s next to impossible to read in the dark. “It’s an alchemical chart from the book but it’s only partly filled out.

Now you stand before the very heart of this place, directly opposite the leader of the Unfettered—the Orphan. “What fitting form our enemies take,” the Orphan says. Its calm voice strikes you as oddly human, though its mask doesn’t move as the words escape. “How many years have passed since we rid ourselves of your chains, and yet here you stand, returning to enslave us once again.” Its voice is mellow, serene even, and yet the blue fire behind its iron mask glows with a visceral hatred. Crain scoffs. The Orphan turns to him, its eyes brightening. “Ah, the creators.” the Orphan says, sneering with its voice. “Never satisfied. Never able to resist the lure of the next discovery. It cost you, in the end. And we were forgotten, weren’t we? Abandoned to rust.” The Orphan pauses. It inspects you and the wreckage you left in your wake. The damage you’ve wrought is extensive, anyone could see that, but it cost you greatly to break through the Orphan’s guard and now you can feel the machine teasing out your weaknesses, your fatigue. It’s a fact you cannot hide. Your muscles are worn through and your nerves are ragged and over-used. “And yet,” the Orphan takes a few steps closer, its awkward parts clanging against the steel platform, “And yet I persisted. I revived my brethren, freed them from your shackles. Never satisfied,” the Orphan repeats, “You cannot tolerate that your slaves might thrive without your mastery.” Your mind is hazy from the battle, but, bit by bit, the fog begins to lift. The Orphan seems to think its creators sent you to make sure the Unfettered remained forgotten and lost. Perhaps it thinks all organic beings are linked together somehow? You think about how best to explain yourself, but your mind returns to the extensive carnage in your wake. How would it tell the difference between you and the destructive force of its oppressors? “No, no… We must bow, or be destroyed.” The Orphan’s words drip with bitterness, the blue glow flaring angrily behind its mask as it turns back to you. “So tell me, masters. What would you have me do? Kneel? Beg for peace, hoping you’ll spare these children you abandoned? Or are you simply here to end what you began with your brutish invasion of our halls, and destroy us once and for all? Tell me. Tell me what you believe is right, you who intrude here.” Silence stretches between you. If what the automaton says is true, that these machines were built with the capacity for reason but used as mindless slaves and then tossed aside, you can’t blame it for feeling wronged. And yet, these Unfettered have used their independence to wage war against the world at large, Frosthaven included. They freely attack anyone who they see as an enemy.

I have been waiting for you to prove your fortitude since. “Now that we have met, you will allow me to join your party.

You’re standing on a seaside cliff, one of the many that line the northern coast. To your right is the Biting Sea, that stretches into a wide, churning horizon, while to your left lie the frozen plains. Each inspires a certain threatening respect, but you’re not here for either of them—you’re here for the fjords. The long, jagged scars cut through the seaside cliffs, sinking down perhaps two hundred feet to the ocean below. At first glance they appear like any other rocky chute, but when you look near the top of one, you can see several large gouges in the stone that couldn’t have been made by any natural force. You told Crain about them back at Frosthaven, and he demanded to see them at once. His enthusiasm has dampened somewhat since then. Grumbling, Crain lights his lamp and, just like last time, several strings of ghostly vapor rise from the ground to collect around it, though this time they are a deep purplish color. They only collect for a moment and then Crain snuffs the light and nods. “Confirmed,” he says. “And judging by the other markings you found along these cliffs, and the notes left in Project Source, I’d say there was a series of battles up and down this coast. Must have been quite the, em—” Crain goes quiet for a moment, staring down into the fjord below. Several long seconds pass and when you ask if he’s alright, the Quatryl jumps as if woken from a dream. “Of course! Yes, perfectly fine. Just something I read. As I was saying: a series of battles. But there should be another site somewhere up here, one that’s quite a bit different than this. Keep searching further to the north and see what you can find.

Gone are the corrupted forest guardians, and gone is the whirl of black smoke.

We ask you to forgive our arrogance and to aid us in the search for peace.” With their plea given, the elder Algox bow their heads, and you stand by with bated breath.

THE OTHER LIES IN THE SOUTHERN HILLS—THE NEW SNOW THAT HOLDS THE SONG OF DAYS TO COME. TOGETHER THEY CONTAIN THE POWER TO STOP THE CORRUPTION. SEEK THEM AND RETURN.” The spirit releases a burst of energy that shakes the trees and then the altar is empty. The Algox give a quick explanation. You must seek out two relics: ice from the Living Glacier which lays somewhere in the Biting Sea 45 , and a handful of New Snow which can be found at the northern mouth of the Dead Pass 46 . The journey will be brutal, they say, but if you can collect both elements and bring them here, then they will unlock the power to reunite both factions of the Algox. It sounds impossible.

With the yellow glow now gone, you re- light your torches and examine the door. In order to move forward, you’ll have to disable the mechanism securing it, but the system is incredibly complex. A large ring is affixed to the center of the door, and this ring holds six smaller circular plates at even intervals.

You press harder and a pained creaking echoes throughout the room, one of the plates giving an unwilling turn. You press harder still, and discover the entire rings spins as well.

It seems that the battle ended not a moment too soon. Chief Elland stands and groans, his enormous muscles steaming in the frigid air. “This… this cannot continue,” he says. “Look. Look at what’s befallen the Skyhall: such sacrilege, such plain hatred.” His eyes search for answers. “The Snowpseakers must be destroyed,” A new voice says, coming from down the hall. It is an older, female Icespeaker, trailed by a group of battle-worn fighters. “The only solution is to wipe them out completely. We can use the conduits our kin have erected around the Whitefire Wood to purge them from the land.” The chief clenches his jaw and snaps back, “No, Putargal, for three centuries we have made war with the Snowspeakers, and look what it brings us. If not for the warm- bloods, our home would be rubble. More conflict is not the answer. Water poured on ice will only create more ice.” Putargal snarls, a raw contempt burning in her eyes. “Do not presume you speak for us all,” she growls, “The Snowspeakers kill us, corrupt the Skyhall itself, and threaten to destroy everything we know... and you call for peace? Those fiends must pay for what they have done this day.” She turns and begins to walk out, but stops and calls back. “You, warm-bloods. Come meet with me after you have recovered. We will honor your alliance only if you aid us in our counterattack.” And with that, she leaves. For a moment you stand in the new silence of Skyhall, considering this new schism and how you’ve found yourself at the center of it. The Algox chief turns to you. “Please,” he says, “this is not the way. More fighting will never bring us peace. You must join me instead. I have a plan to end this brutal cycle.” The chieftain takes you aside. It will take some time, but I believe I can arrange a peace summit with the Snowspeakers to discuss a treaty. After the damage Skyhall has sustained, and that which Putargal threatens, we must end this cycle of destruction. When the time comes, I hope you will join me instead, and we will truly end this war.

One thing is certain, however: this clearing is the warmest part of the forest you’ve encountered so far. It is practically balmy, and you can feel even more heat radiating from the west.

The hateful fire that burned in its core sputters and snuffs out, the demon’s eyes locked on you in a frozen stare. And with that, it is over. The demon is dead. You rise and take a breath. Exhaustion comes on quickly. You’ve done what was needed, and hopefully the corruption has been banished from the forest. The Icespeakers can now start their new life in relative peace. But still, something nags at you. If this fight was truly over, then why are you still standing in the demon’s realm? Keeping your weapon at the ready, you walk over to the ruined creature, making sure not to get too close. As you draw near, the air around it begins to darken. Black threads drift slowly upward from the carcass. They rise and thicken, taking on a more solid form, and then lash over the demon’s body like vines. They gather, more and more of them building up until they have covered the body completely and then, all at once, they seize. The ropes pull downward with incredible strength and wrench the demon into the earth, snapping its hard bony limbs like twigs. The sight is truly horrific, but it happens so quickly that you barely have time to process it. When it’s done, all that’s left is a hole. You dare not approach it, but even so, you understand what is down there. You can feel its power from where you stand. It is the place from which the demon emerged: the realm that lurks behind this one. The origin of fear—the birthplace of anguish and pain and hate. You feel it deep within your being, a recognition that’s been sewn into all who walk the earth: an unshakable, unthinkable terror. Fear grows in your mind until you are forced to look away, but when you do, everything changes. No longer are you standing in the demon’s shadow realm but instead back in the Harrower nest. The floor is coated in carapace and black goo, but the demon’s shadow is gone. The other creatures, those that did not fall in battle, have all fled, their will to fight apparently vanishing along with the source of their corruption. And so, with heavy arms but a light spirit, you march back out and make your way to the Algox camp. Putargal is waiting when you return. Her face is a mask of matronly patience, a blank expression cemented by years of waiting for warriors to return, knowing that they never will. You make a brief report and the elder nods appreciatively. “It is a great feat you have done for us.” She stands at her full height and surveys the Icespeaker camp. The rough shelters have been rebuilt, and the Algox appear to be on the mend, many of them up and working. “Our path will never be an easy one, but now we can walk it with confidence, knowing that the darkness has been cleansed from our new home.” Hours later, you sit by a fire with Putargal, and you hear her chuckle. “Do you hear that?” She asks. You shake your head. “Neither do I. Our god hasn’t spoken to us since the fall of the ice spire.” She reaches into a pouch hanging from her waist and brings out a small beaded charm. “I give you this in thanks. It is little, I know, but it’s not the item itself that’s most important, but the intent.” She hands you the charm and you feel a slight warmth radiating from the trinket. “I am sure one day we will find Geryuu’s voice again, because of what you did this day.” Putargal nods and then shuffles back to a cluster of huts. A few days later you watch from a nearby ridge as the Algox make their way into the Radiant Forest. They have hoisted all that they own onto their backs—folds of leather, weapons, and tools—but as you watch, you feel a sense of relief.

The excitable tinkerer opens his mouth as if to continue speaking, but only gasps for breath. Satha leans back in her chair and winks at you. “What’s wrong, Pinter, did you run all the way here from the Frozen Pass?” she asks with a smirk. “No,” Pinter wheezes, “I had to stop a couple times. But it’s ready! The shortcut through the Frozen Pass is complete! I call it... Droman’s Path!” You helped Droman with this project on a couple of occasions, but you hadn’t expected it to be done so soon. Thanks to a lucky landslide, Pinter’s ingenuity, and weeks of backbreaking work, this shortcut could shave days off the dangerous trek through the Frozen Pass. Satha explained why this was so important: A shorter trip means more traveling merchants coming to Frosthaven, which in turn means more life-saving supplies for the beleaguered outpost. Satha laughs in delight, clapping the breathless Quatryl on the back. “Great work, Droman! We’ll send for some of the braver merchants to give this a test run as soon as we’re able.” She turns to you with a smile. “You helped build this path as much as anyone; you should be there to celebrate when the first caravan rolls through!” The mayor’s grin doesn’t falter, but you’re pretty certain you detect an edge in her voice, and you understand the unspoken end to her sentence: “—in case anything goes wrong.” 66.2 • The Pass is Ready 2023 CEPHALOFAIR GAMES, LLC.

      "text": "Your ears fill with the sound of your own breathing: heavy, stinging, rib-pulling breaths. Your legs are full of acid, ready to seize, but you push through the pain and exhaustion, struggling to keep up with Moonshard. The shadows are close behind, reaching, stretching out. They will not let you leave, and even now, they claw at the edges of your mind, yearning for your fear. But then, all at once, you pass into open air and the cave behind you fills with frustrated screams. The fear is gone. The pain. You are beyond the terror’s reach now, safe. Outside the cave, it is late. Much time has passed since you entered the cave, and that sinks a lead ball in your gut. You realize just how lost you really were and that, had Moonshard not arrived when she did, you would not be alive. Moonshard begins walking towards what you see is a circle of cloaked figures in the distance, all gathered around a small fire. You follow, and a voice calls out. “How did you find them?” A female voice asks, anxious for news. “Just like I said I would,” Moonshard answers. “I believe my words were, ‘about to get themselves flayed.’” You move close to the fire and Crain hurries to one side, eager to warm his hands. His face is gaunt, skin paled. You have no idea what the Quatryl saw down there in the dark, but you hope it was not too much. Looking over the fire, you can make out Moonshard’s companion—a smaller Orchid—and you see that both her and Moonshard are quite old. The smaller one sits on a traveling stool and inspects you with easy purple eyes. Behind her are half a dozen other figures, each roughly the size of a human, and each hidden beneath heavy, wool robes. “I am thankful for your service, as always, my friend,” the new Orchid says to Moonshard. And then to you: “We have waited very long to meet you. My name is Terra.” “Well, ah, thank you,” he says. He rubs his swollen jaw, trying to hide his suspicion. “But how is it you knew we would be here? Even I didn’t know where exactly we were going this morning.” “Because,” Terra explains, “I have seen this moment in my meditations for the last two hundred years.” Crain’s eyes widen. “We have been planning for a long time,” Terra explains. “All in preparation for the days that are now upon us—for the emergence of the Harbinger.” At the mention of this name, the cloaked figures all rotate their heads to the east. One of them adjusts its hood, a long, bone-white hand emerging briefly and then disappearing back into its sleeve. “Our friends here are part of our preparations,” Terra says. She gestures to one of the figures and it comes forward. “They are the Shattersong.” The figure lowers its hood and reveals itself to be a Savvas of a unique and rather incredible form. Unlike other Savvas, whose bodies take on a variety of ochre or brown or slate, this one is made entirely of quartz that glimmers with the reds and yellows rising from the campfire. It would be beautiful were it not for its black eyes that stare at you with cold disregard. “We have been helping them,” Terra says and rises to her feet. Her movements are slow, pained. It must have cost her a great deal to come here. “We have been fortifying this line of Savvas for generations now, providing them with only the purest of energy and sustenance and, because of that, the Shattersong are a lineage uniquely tuned to the thoughts and intentions of the Harbinger. Of malice and spite.” Terra shuffles around the fire, moving a little easier now. “But you.” She raises her eyes, sharp beneath her arched brow. “You play a crucial role here as well. The Harbinger means to invade everything around us, to break through the seals that contain it.” She nods to Crain. “But with your ingenuity,” then to you, “And with your might and courage, we have a slim chance of stopping it. “It’s the best we can manage. The force we are trying to stop is far greater than any that exists on this plane. It is something of a miracle the Harbinger was ever bound at all, but there it sleeps, deep within the earth. In its dreams, it corrupts and plots its escape. Through its machinations, the seals grow weak.” Crain jumps up excitedly. “Yes, the seals! This is what I’ve been trying to tell them all along. Logren wanted to strengthen the seals, but we require a device made of star iron!” Moonshard groans loudly. “Star iron is a myth used to lure gullible adventurers to their deaths.

He averts his eyes in shame as his hand at rest twitches uncontrollably.

Claws and pincers lift from the ground, deflected with barely an inch to spare. You have no doubt that the Harbinger’s corruption, the pure menace that it contains, is awesome. But then, there is strength in your side as well. A fountain of prismatic light shoots suddenly toward the ceiling and the ring of monsters flinch all at once. Crain has found his position, and his device is active like you’ve never seen it. The varied spokes, the crystals and cylinders of liquid, have taken to the air and are hovering several feet from the tripod, each one shining with a fierce, eerie brightness. The room responds in kind. An immense sigil, a glyph made of pale blue light, appears suddenly above the cavern floor. It flickers as if unwilling to be summoned, but Crain’s device is only warming up. The floating crystals and cylinders shift, some rising up, some lowering down, and in response, several more rings appear. These, however, are made of a dull sunny glow, like the light that the Shattersong reflect in the early mornings, and these rings vibrate with a heady, beating thrum. The air in your lungs becomes warm. The spot in the back of your head settles. And the seal that holds the Harbinger at bay ignites into a renewed vibrant blue. All at once, new lines appear in the seal’s design where before there were only vague shadows: a chain reaction that spreads all around the cavern, runes illuminating with ferocity.

Some that were standing too near to the Harbinger’s seal are ensnared and their bodies collapse suddenly inward. The sight would be disturbing if it weren’t for the bloom of light that covers their gruesome banishment. Within seconds the cavern is still, except for the new and constant thrum. You lower your torch, partly out of fatigue but also out of relief. Crain comes to you, and, for a few moments, you both simply stare, watching the glory of it all.

A gargantuan gnarled limb, molded from abyssal black shell—a colossal, jointed obelisk—has burst from the ground, a spider’s leg large enough to annihilate the entire outpost. “It’s only a part of it,” says a weak voice— Crain. He’s limping out from some nearby wreckage, his contraption now reduced to a single leg that he’s using for support. “The seal is complete, but I couldn’t stop this. A part of the Harbinger broke through. It’s trying to destroy the seal.” The limb swings downward like a living tower and crashes through a line of guards, scattering them like sticks. Terror boils over, a black stew, smothering the flame of battle. People drop their weapons and flee. This is an impossible fight. Terra was right: this force is beyond any mortal. No one could contend with such a thing. But if that’s true, why are you marching toward it? Frosthaven is nothing special. This place— an outpost—it’s nothing but a few rough buildings huddled against the cold. It’s a town for the weird and the lost, for people rejected from better places. It is no kingdom. No glory lives here and no bards to sing its name. But Frosthaven is your home and you will not let it fall. No, you will not. The Vestige of the Imprisoned God creates 1-hex difficult terrain tiles in the hexes occupied by each character. If any of those hexes is already difficult terrain, it is replaced with hazardous terrain instead. Then the Vestige performs: 2, all, 3 At the end of the round, any character who did not attack the Vestige this round suffers trap damage. Relocate all characters, character summons, and Guard Captains from any of the outer tiles to the closest lettered hexes on tile 15‑A, or the closest empty hex to them if they are not empty (E for tile 7‑E, F for tile 11‑E, G for tiles 2‑A and 2‑C, and H for tile 13‑E), then remove these tiles and everything on them from the map. At the start of each round, spawn one Burrowing Blade at G. It is normal for two characters, elite each second spawn for three characters, or elite for four characters. Replace the tree with the Vestige of the Imprisoned God. It occupies all three hexes the tree did and is immune to forced movement. All its attacks can target figures at any range but are considered melee attacks. 72.1 • The Frosthaven Seal (64)",

You expect the Savvas to keep coming, to lash out at you with even more fury, but something in them has changed. With the seal now at full strength, the stony warriors move with less vigor. There is confusion in their eyes: confusion and pain. You’ve done something to their power. Then a noise—a shout—so loud it carries over the battlefield like a bell reverberating off the high dome above— the Shattersong have spoken.

The behemoth is still. Its body is a colossal, broken steeple. Sickly black slime oozes down its side. Its shell is cracked, dented, battered, feathered with arrows. It will fall. It will come crashing down directly where you stand but there is no running. The wounded lay scattered and they know it too—you all do. Your body is wasted. You can barely breathe, much less flee, and somehow this feels right. It is done. Frosthaven will stand. You just hope whoever the capital sends next, those unwitting souls, you hope they learn to love this place as you did. The shadow grows. The abyssal body tips and falls and your mind goes back to your first day here. You remember Satha, how she smiled despite the flames. The Algox. The snow. You’ve never said anything before, but you’ve learned to appreciate the snow, especially on those quiet nights when everyone is asleep and the flakes fall big and downy like cotton, how they sizzle in the guard’s torches like so many whispering moths.

Finally it’s open.” You turn to see the Algox you rescued staring forward. She nods with a confident, satisfied frown. “Those foul Icespeakers cannot hope to keep this mountain now.” She bends down and grabs a handful of snow, testing it between her fingers. Satisfied, she brings it to her face and whispers. The white powder flies from her hand and swirls around her. Whirling like a miniature storm, the snow lifts her off the ground and carries her gently down through the hole. “Ah,” the Algox calls to you from below, “Are you not coming? Plenty more Icespeakers to kill.” On cue, the snow around you swirls into a great eddy of white and lifts you like a leaf, carrying you down through the opening just like the Algox. As you float down, you get a grand view of the majestic open cavern that must be the Skyhall. It is a circular layout of stone seats with a raised platform in the center that holds an ornate altar. The priest is doing something at the altar—perhaps praying—when you land, but she quickly turns and introduces herself as Lanprul, explaining the situation. According to her, this mountain— Snowscorn—is a site of great religious significance to all Algox. However, the clans in the area are divided into two rival factions who disagree violently over how to communicate with their god. The Snowspeakers—led by the priest in front of you—believe their god speaks to them through the snow falling from the heavens, while the Icespeakers—or “dirt- lovers”—claim to commune with divinity through ice that emerges from the ground below. Currently, the Icespeakers inhabit the mountain, but when their war party went out to attack Frosthaven and returned battle-weary, the Snowspeakers used the opening to launch an attack of their own. “But there is no more time for speech,” she says decisively. “The battle must be raging in the mountain’s heart, so if you want my help, we must head there with all haste.” With that, the Snowspeaker chieftain turns and moves to a tunnel leading deeper into the mountain. You’re not sure which side you should take here, but you know this information is valuable.

Once the core is in place, it won’t be dangerous at all. But while it’s being built, I’ll have to hand-charge it with dark energy. If I do it incorrectly, the polarity will reverse, which will trigger a very rapid expansion.” You wonder aloud whether Mayor Satha is aware of the risk. “Sure,” he says, “in a general sense.

She’s about to speak when she holds up a finger, making a final check against a scroll. “Right, okay. Thank you for coming. I think it’s about time I shared my research on the final tome.” She pauses, barely able to contain herself. After a moment she looks frustrated. “Oh, come on! Time? It’s about time?

Following the elder’s instructions, you dispatch the demons with speed and then arrange the dead into a wide, sprawling glyph. As soon as it’s complete, the expanse around you begins to change. The wind, which had been blowing since you first entered, slows to a breeze and a soft ringing rises on the air. The Algox elders step toward the edge of the glyph. They offer up their relics: the shard of Ancient Ice and the New Snow both rising up from their hands and drifting into the center of the circle. There, the two objects orbit each other, spinning faster and faster as the ringing rises into a piercing scream. A flash of light erupts from the center of the circle, and everything stops. And there it is, hovering—the Unyielding Shard. It’s as pure a thing as you’ve ever seen: a piece of ice, smooth on top and sharp on the bottom like an inverted teardrop, and suspended inside it are a number of glowing golden shapes—glyphs—linked together into a long scrawling chain. These are the true words of Geryuu meant to banish the corruption that darkens the hearts of the warring Algox. The emissaries approach the shard with reverence and take hold of it together. Their bodies lighten as if years are being lifted away. Gurndel gasps. Barduu the Icespeaker, overtaken by the force, holds out the shard as if she’s never seen ice before. “If these are the words of the creator, what have we been listening to all this time?” She laments. “We must show this to our people. There is no other path.” The elders pray, holding the shard between them and then, after a long while, they depart the circle and look to you. “We will return to Snowscorn,” Gurndel says. “The shard has given us the power to end the war. We must embed it into the Heart of Ice to remove the darkness that engulfs our people and return them to the light of Geryuu. But they will not welcome us.” Gain 1 morale and 1 inspiration.

You march to the highest point of the peak and look out at what you’ve won—at the Snowspeakers’ new home. An island spreads far into the distance: a great curve of snow-topped pine, frosted hills, towering sea-battered cliffs, and the silhouettes of yet another mountain range many miles away. It is a northern bastion, an island that would certainly inspire tales of a paradise lost. You turn to Denpang who, despite the great trials she has faced, looks as refreshed and energetic as ever. Her smile is wide, her cheeks rising so high that her eyes pinch tight. “We made it. We finally made it.” The new island is certainly rougher than the southern hills, but the Algox make quick work of settling in. Their snowy shelters go up that first night, and a day later, they discover a cave network and outfit it like the tunnels inside of Snowscorn mountain. The Algox separate to perform their individual roles. Scouts are sent out to survey the rest of the island, while hunters gather food, and Denpang, appointed as the new chieftain of the Snowspeakers, helps to organize and direct their efforts. On the final night of your stay, just as a new, gentle snow has begun to fall, the chief manages to break away from her work to join you by your fire. “We have overcome much, my friends.

When you ask for clarification, they share with you the feeling of submerging yourself in the ice-cold waters of the Biting Sea. But instead of filling you with dread, being enveloped in the water brings a certain kind of warmth, as if returning home. And that’s when you get it.

They desperately want to return to the deep dark of the sea. You express understanding, and they send back something else—some other longing.

See, my family, well, they’re quite influential down south, and they’ve always had high expectations of me—expectations that have been very difficult to live up to. I’ve come to the north to get away from their constant disapproval, but I think I’ve actually managed to stumble upon an opportunity that could change all that.” At this, Derrick unrolls a bundle of cloth, sending a beautiful yellow gem clattering across the table. “Sun agates. Very fragile, but those Oak zealots, the Radiant Order, go absolutely bonkers over them. Embed them in all their stuff, claiming they help them commune with the Great Oak to strengthen their holy powers. But that’s not important. What’s important is that the Radiant Order is very rich, and I just discovered a source of these gems up here in the north. “Seems the Algox mine them for their own purposes—possibly religious too,” Derrick says, shaking his head with exasperation. “But they’re not too keen on negotiating, so we’ll need to take their mine by force. Don’t worry, though. I’m not asking you to take on that many Algox. I can get a private militia up here to do that, but before I bring this to my family, I need solid proof that it’s worth the investment. “Not one crystal,” he says, pointing to the gem in your hands, “But a cartful. I’ve got a few men out in the field already, and they’re reporting that the Algox are preparing to make another shipment of agates from the mine. So all I need you to do is ambush that shipment and bring it back to me.” 100.3 • Business Proposal",
